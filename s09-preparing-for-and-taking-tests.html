        <h2 class="title editable block">Tested at Every Turn</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p01">Testing is a part of life. Have you ever participated in an athletic event? Completed a crossword puzzle? Acted in a play? Cooked dinner? Answered a child’s question? Prepared a cost estimate? All of these common life situations are forms of tests because they measure how much we know about a specific subject at a single point in time. They alone are not good measurements about how smart or gifted you are—they show only how much you know or can do at that moment. We can learn from how we have performed, and we can think about how to apply what we have learned to do even better next time. We can have fun measuring our progress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p02">Many of our daily activities are measurements of progress toward mastery of skills or knowledge. We welcome these opportunities as both work and fun. But when these opportunities are part of our academic life, we often dread them and rarely feel any sense of fun. In reality, however, academic tests are similar to real-life tests in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_l01">
            <li>They help us measure our progress toward mastery of a particular skill.</li>
            <li>They are not a representation of how smart, talented, or skilled we are but rather are a measurement only of what we know about a specific subject at a specific point in time.</li>
            <li>They are extraordinary learning opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p03">Academic tests in college are different from those you took in high school. College instructors expect to see much more of <em class="emphasis">you</em> in an exam: your thoughts, your interpretations, your thinking process, your conclusions. High school teachers usually look for your ability to repeat precisely what you read in your text or heard in your class. Success on high school tests relies much more on memorization than on understanding the material. This is why you need to modify your study habits and your strategies for taking exams in college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p04">Take a look at the learning cycle in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch06_s00_f01">Figure 6.2 "The Learning Cycle: Review and Apply"</a>. In this chapter, we cover reviewing and applying the material you learn; preparing for and taking exams is the practical application of this phase.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p05">The end and the beginning of the learning cycle are both involved in test taking, as we’ll see in this chapter. We will discuss the best study habits for effective review and strategies for successful application of your knowledge in tests and exams. Finally, we will cover how the review and application processes set you up for additional learning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p06">Let’s start at the top of the cycle. You have invested your time in preparing for class, you have been an active listener in class, and you have asked questions and taken notes. You have summarized what you learned and have looked for opportunities to apply the material. You have completed your reading assignments and compared your reading notes with your class notes. And now you hear your instructor say, “Remember the exam next week.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p07">A sense of dread takes over. You worry about the exam and what might be on it. You stay up for a couple of nights trying to work through the volumes of material the course has covered. Learning or remembering it all seems hopeless. You find yourself staring at the same paragraph in your text over and over again, but you just don’t seem to get it. As the exam looms closer, you feel your understanding of the material is slipping away. You show up to the exam and the first questions look familiar, but then you draw a blank—you’re suffering from test anxiety.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_p02">If you answered true to any of the statements in the table above, you have suffered some of the symptoms of test anxiety. Most of us have experienced this. It is normal to feel stress before an exam, and in fact, that may be a good thing. Stress motivates you to study and review, generates adrenaline to help sharpen your reflexes and focus while taking the exam, and may even help you remember some of the material you need. But suffering too many stress symptoms or suffering any of them severely will impede your ability to show what you have learned. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Test anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological condition in which a person feels distress before, during, or after a test or exam to the point where stress causes poor performance.</span></span> is a psychological condition in which a person feels distress before, during, or after a test or exam to the point where stress causes poor performance. Anxiety during a test interferes with your ability to recall knowledge from memory as well as your ability to use higher-level thinking skills effectively. To learn more about critical thinking and study skills, see <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch03#lochhaas-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking about Thought"</a> and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>, respectively.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_p03">There are steps you should take if you find that stress is getting in your way:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be prepared.</strong> A primary cause of test anxiety is not knowing the material. If you take good class and reading notes and review them regularly, this stressor should be greatly reduced if not eliminated. You should be confident going into your exam (but not overconfident).</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bounce bad vibes.</strong> Your own negative thoughts—“I’ll never pass this exam” or “I can’t figure this out, I must be really stupid!”—may move you into spiraling stress cycle that in itself causes enough anxiety to block your best efforts. When you feel you are brewing a storm of negative thoughts, stop what you are doing and clear your mind. Allow yourself to daydream a little; visualize yourself in pleasant surroundings with good friends. Don’t go back to work until you feel the tension release. Sometimes it helps to take a deep breath and shout “STOP!” and then proceed with clearing your mind. Once your mind is clear, repeat a reasonable affirmation to yourself—“I know this stuff”—before continuing your work.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visualize success.</strong> Picture what it will feel like to get that A. Translate that vision into specific, reasonable goals and work toward each individual goal. Take one step at a time and reward yourself for each goal you complete.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">It’s all about you!</strong> Don’t waste your time comparing yourself to other students in the class, especially during the exam. Keep focused on your own work and your own plan. Exams are not a race, so it doesn’t matter who turns in their paper first. Certainly you have no idea how they did on their exam, so a thought like “Kristen is already done, she must have aced it, I wish I had her skills” is counterproductive and will only cause additional anxiety.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have a plan and follow it.</strong> As soon as you know that an exam is coming, you can develop a plan for studying. As soon as you get your exam paper, you should develop a plan for the exam itself. We’ll discuss this more later in this chapter. Don’t wait to cram for an exam at the last minute; the pressure you put on yourself and the late night will cause more anxiety, and you won’t learn or retain much.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make sure you eat well and get a good night’s sleep before the exam.</strong> Hunger, poor eating habits, energy drinks, and lack of sleep all contribute to test anxiety.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Chill!</strong> You perform best when you are relaxed, so learn some relaxation exercises you can use during an exam. Before you begin your work, take a moment to listen to your body. Which muscles are tense? Move them slowly to relax them. Tense them and relax them. Exhale, then continue to exhale for a few more seconds until you feel that your lungs are empty. Inhale slowly through your nose and feel your rib cage expand as you do. This will help oxygenate your blood and reenergize your mind. <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a> has more tips for dealing with stress.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_p01">You have truly learned material when you can readily recall it and actually use it—on tests or in real-life situations. Effective studying is your most important tool to combat test anxiety, but more important, effective studying helps you truly master the material and be able to apply it as you need to, in school and beyond.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_p02">In <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a> and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch05#lochhaas-ch05">Chapter 5 "Reading to Learn"</a>, we set the foundation for effective learning. You learned how to listen and how to take notes. You learned some tricks for improving your memory. You learned how to read actively and how to capture information from written sources. Now we’ll follow up on some of those key ideas and take the learning cycle to its conclusion and a new beginning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_p03">The reviewing and applying stage of the learning cycle involves studying and using the material you have been exposed to in your course. Recall that in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a> and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch05#lochhaas-ch05">Chapter 5 "Reading to Learn"</a> we emphasized the importance of reviewing your notes soon after the class or assignment. This review is largely what studying is all about.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_p04">Effective studying is an ongoing process of reviewing course material. The first and most important thing you should know is that studying is not something you do a few days before an exam. To be effective, studying is something you do as part of an ongoing learning process, throughout the duration of the term.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Studying Every Day</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Studying begins after each class or assignment when you review your notes. Each study session should involve three steps:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Gather your learning materials.</strong> Take time to merge your class notes with your reading notes. How do they complement each other? Stop and think. What do the notes tell you about your material? What aspects of the material are you unsure about? Do you need to reread a part of your text? Write down any questions you have for your instructor and pay a visit during office hours. It is better to clear up any misconceptions and get your questions answered soon after you are exposed to the material, rather than to wait, for two reasons: (1) the question or doubt is fresh in your mind and you won’t forget about it and (2) instructors usually build their lessons on material already presented. If you don’t take these steps now, you are setting yourself up for problems later in the course.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Apply or visualize.</strong> What does this material mean to <em class="emphasis">you</em>? How will <em class="emphasis">you</em> use this new knowledge? Try to find a way to apply it in your own life or thoughts. If you can’t use the knowledge right away, visualize yourself using the knowledge to solve a problem or visualize yourself teaching the material to other students.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cement your knowledge.</strong> If you use the two-column note-taking method, cover up the right side of your notes with a piece of paper, leaving the questions in the left column exposed. Test yourself by trying to answer your questions without referring to your notes. How did you do? If you are unsure about anything, look up the answer and write it down right away. Don’t let a wrong answer be the last thing you wrote on a subject, because you will most likely continue to remember the wrong answer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Studying in Course Units</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s02_p01">At the end of each unit, or at least every two weeks or so, use your notes and textbook to write an outline or summary of the material in your own words. (Remember the paragraphs you wrote to summarize each class or reading? They’ll be very helpful to you here.) After you have written the summary or outline, go back and reread your outline from the prior unit followed by the one you just wrote. Does the new one build on the earlier one? Do you feel confident you understand the material?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Studying before the Exam</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s03_p01">At least a week before a major exam, ask yourself these questions: What has the instructor said about what is included on the exam? Has the instructor said anything about what types of questions will be included? If you were the instructor, what questions would you ask on an exam? Challenge yourself to come up with some really tough open-ended questions. Think about how you might answer them. Be sure to go to any review sessions the instructor or your section leader holds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s03_p02">Now go back and review your outlines. Do they cover what the instructor has suggested might be on the exam? After reviewing your outlines, reread the sections of your notes that are most closely associated with expected exam questions. Pay special attention to those items the instructor emphasized during class. Read key points aloud and write them down on index cards. Make flash cards to review in downtimes, such as when you’re waiting for a bus or for a class to start.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">More Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Schedule a consistent study-review time for each course at least once a week</strong>, in addition to your class and assignment time. Keep to that schedule as rigorously as you do your class schedule. Use your study time to go through the steps outlined earlier; this is not meant to be a substitute for your assignment time.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get yourself in the right space.</strong> Choose to study in a quiet, well-lit space. Your chair should be comfortable but provide good support. Remember that libraries were designed for reading and should be your first option.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Minimize distractions.</strong> Turn off your cell phone and get away from Facebook, television, other nearby activities, and chatty friends or roommates. All of these can cut into the effectiveness of your study efforts. Multitasking and studying don’t mix.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you will be studying for a long time, take short breaks at least once an hour.</strong> Get up, stretch, breathe deeply, and then get back to work. (If you keep up with your daily assignments and schedule weekly review sessions for yourself—and keep them—there should be almost no need for long study sessions.)</li>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Studying in Groups</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s05_p01">Study groups are a great idea—as long as they are thoughtfully managed. A study group can give you new perspectives on course material and help you fill in gaps in your notes. Discussing course content will sharpen your critical thinking related to the subject, and being part of a group to which you are accountable will help you study consistently. In a study group, you will end up “teaching” each other the material, which is the strongest way to retain new material. But remember, being in a group working together doesn’t mean there will be less work for you as an individual; your work will just be much more effective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s05_p02">Here are some tips for creating and managing effective study groups:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Think small.</strong> Limit your study group to no more than three or four people. A larger group would limit each student’s participation and make scheduling of regular study sessions a real problem.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Go for quality.</strong> Look for students who are doing well in the course, who ask questions, and who participate in class discussions. Don’t make friendship the primary consideration for who should be in your group. Meet up with your friends instead during “social time”—study time is all about learning.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look for complementary skills and learning styles.</strong> Complementary skills make for a good study group because your weaknesses will be countered by another student’s strengths. When a subject requires a combination of various skills, strengths in each of those skills is helpful (e.g., a group with one student who is really good at physics and another at math would be perfect for an engineering course). Finally, a variety of learning styles is helpful because each of you pick up differing signals and emphases from the instructor that you can share with each other, so you will not likely miss important points.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meet regularly.</strong> When you first set up a study group, agree to a regular meeting schedule and stick to it. Moving study session times around can result in nonparticipation, lack of preparation, and eventually the collapse of the study group. Equally important is keeping your sessions to the allotted times.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Tests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p01">All tests are designed to determine how much you know about a particular subject at a particular point in time. But you should be aware of differences in types of tests because this will help guide how you prepare for them. Two general types of tests are based on their objectives, or how they are intended to be used: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formative assessments</a><span class="glossdef">A test or quiz used to determine a student’s basic understanding of material before taking on more challenging ideas.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summative assessments</a><span class="glossdef">A test or exam used by an instructor to determine if a student has mastered the material sufficiently to get credit for the course.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Formative assessments include quizzes, unit tests, pop quizzes, and review quizzes from a textbook or its Web site. Their main objective is to make sure you know the fundamental material before moving on to more challenging topics. Because these quizzes usually don’t count much toward your final grade, many students think they are not very important. In fact, these quizzes are very important, particularly to you; they can help you to identify what you know and what you still need to learn to be successful in the course and in applying the material. A poor result on a quiz may not negatively affect your final grade much—but learning from its results and correcting your mistakes <em class="emphasis">will</em> affect your final grade, on the positive side, when you take midterms and finals! More on this in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06_s06#lochhaas-ch06_s06">Section 6.6 "Using Test Results"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p03">Summative assessments include midterms and finals. They are used by the instructor to determine if you are mastering a large portion of the material, and as such, they usually carry a heavy weight toward your final grade for the course. Because of this, they often result in high levels of test anxiety and long study periods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p04">In addition to this classification by objective, tests can also be grouped into various categories based on how they are delivered. Each type has its own peculiar strategies.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Paper tests</strong> are still the most common type of test, requiring students to write answers on the test pages or in a separate test booklet. They are typically used for in-class tests. Neatness and good grammar count, even if it’s not an English exam. Remember that the instructor will be reading dozens of test papers and will not likely spend much time trying to figure out your hieroglyphics, arrows, and cross-outs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Open-book tests</strong> allow the student to consult their notes, textbook, or both while taking the exam. Instructors often give this type of test when they are more interested in seeing your thoughts and critical thinking than your memory power. Be prepared to expose and defend your own viewpoints. When preparing, know where key material is present in your book and notes; create an index for your notes and use sticky notes to flag key pages of your textbook before the exam. Be careful when copying information or formulas to your test answers, because nothing looks worse in an open-book exam than misusing the material at your disposal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take-home tests</strong> are like open-book tests except you have the luxury of time on your side. Make sure you submit the exam on time. Know what the instructor’s expectations are about the content of your answers. The instructor will likely expect more detail and more complete work because you are not under a strict time limit and because you have access to reference materials. Be clear about when the test is due. (Some instructors will ask you to e-mail your exam to them by a specific time.) Also find out if the instructor allows or expects you to collaborate with classmates. Be sure to type your exam and don’t forget to spell-check!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Online tests</strong> are most commonly used for formative assessments, although they are starting to find their way into high-stakes exams, particularly in large lecture classes that fulfill a graduation requirement (like introductory psychology or history survey courses). The main advantage of online tests is that they can be computer graded, providing fast feedback to the student (with formative tests) and allowing the instructor to grade hundreds of exams easily (with summative assessments). Since these tests are computer graded, be aware that the instructor’s judgment is not involved in the grading. Your answers will be either right or wrong; there is no room for partially correct responses. With online tests, be sure you understand the testing software. Are there practice questions? If so, make sure you use them. Find out if you will be allowed to move freely between test sections to go back and check your work or to complete questions you might have skipped. Some testing software does not allow you to return to sections once they are “submitted.” Unless your exam needs to be taken at a specific time, don’t wait until the last minute to take the test. Should you have technical problems, you want to have time to resolve the issues. To avoid any conflicts with the testing software, close all other software applications before beginning the testing software.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Electronic tests in the classroom</strong> are becoming more common as colleges install “smart classrooms” with technology such as wireless “clicker” technology that instructors may use to get a quick read of students’ understanding of a lecture. This testing method allows for only true-or-false and multiple-choice questions, so it is rarely used for summative assessments. When taking this kind of quick quiz, take notes on questions you miss so that you can focus on them when you do your own review.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Presentations and oral tests</strong> are the most complete means for instructors to evaluate students’ mastery of material, because the evaluation is highly interactive. The instructor can (and likely will) probe you on certain points, question your assumptions, or ask you to defend your point of view. Make sure you practice your presentation many times with and without an audience (your study group is good for this). Have a clear and concise point of view and keep to the allotted time. (You don’t want to miss delivering a killer close if your instructor cuts you off because you weren’t aware of the time!) <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch07#lochhaas-ch07">Chapter 7 "Interacting with Instructors and Classes"</a> covers public speaking and class presentations in more detail. Use the same strategies in oral exams.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Taking Tests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_p01">You’ve reviewed the material for a test and feel confident that you will do well. You have brought your test anxiety into control. What else can you do to ensure success on a test? Learn and apply these top ten test-taking strategies:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn as much as you can about the test.</strong> What has the instructor told you about the test? Will it be open book? What types of questions will be on it? Are there parts of the test that will be worth more points than others? Will it be cumulative or just cover the most recent material? Will you have choices about which questions to answer?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Try to foresee the questions likely to be on the test.</strong> What kinds of questions would you include if you were the instructor? Brainstorm possible questions with your study group. Look for possible questions in your notes. Review past quizzes and tests to see what kinds of questions the instructor likes to ask. Above all, take it seriously whenever your instructor warns, “This will be on the test.”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t be tempted to stay up late cramming. Get some exercise and watch what you eat.</strong> Cramming is not a substitute for doing your assignments and studying consistently over time. It is far more important to get a good night’s sleep and face your test fresh and well rested. A good workout the day before an exam will help you be fresh and stay focused during the exam (provided you already like to work out; if not, find time to take a long walk). A healthy diet the night before and the day of the exam will give you energy and concentration to do well on the exam. Include “brain foods,” such as those rich in omega-3 oils, and avoid “heavy” foods that are rich in fat and sugar. (After the exam, you can celebrate with a cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake—but not before the exam!)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get to the test site early.</strong> Take out all your allowable tools (pencils, pens, calculator, etc.). Turn off your cell phone (yes, all the way off, not on vibrate) as a way of disconnecting from your everyday world. Do some of the relaxation exercises described earlier for controlling test anxiety.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create a test plan.</strong> Listen carefully to the directions given by the instructor. When you receive your test, scan the entire test first. Evaluate the importance of each section. Then create a time allocation plan. Decide how much time you should dedicate to each section. You don’t want to spend 80 percent of your time on a question worth 10 percent of the grade.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write it down.</strong> Take a couple minutes to write down key facts, dates, principles, statistics, and formulas on a piece of scratch paper or in the margin of the exam paper. Do this while you are still fresh and aren’t yet feeling time pressure (when it will be harder to remember them). Then you can refer to these notes as you take the exam.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read the directions carefully.</strong> Then reread them. Do you understand what is expected of you? If not, ask the instructor to be sure you are clear. Too many students lose points simply by not following directions completely!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do the easy questions first.</strong> By getting the easy questions out of the way, you’ll feel more confident about the test and have more time to think about the tougher questions. Start with the objective sections of the exam first (multiple choice, true or false, and matching columns). As you answer these questions, keep an eye out for facts or concepts you may want to use later in an essay question.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep an eye on the time.</strong> Keep as close to your plan as possible. If you see that you are running out of time, don’t panic. Move to those questions you think you can still answer accurately within the remaining time.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check your work.</strong> This doesn’t mean going through all your calculations again. Start by ensuring that you have <em class="emphasis">complete</em> answers according to the directions. Then look for other common mistakes, such as a misplaced decimal point, dropped words (especially those that can modify the answer, like “not”), and any incomplete or incomprehensible phrases.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Strategies for Math and Science Exams</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p01">Math tests require some special strategies because they are often problem based rather than question based.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Do the following before the test:</strong></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Attend all classes and complete all assignments. Pay special attention to working on all assigned problems. After reviewing problems in class, take careful notes about what you did incorrectly. Repeat the problem and do a similar one as soon as possible. It is important that the last solution to a problem in your mind is a correct solution.</li>
                <li>Think about how each problem solution might be applied in a real-world situation. This helps make even the most complex solutions relevant and easier to learn.</li>
                <li>In your study group, take turns presenting solutions to problems and observing and correcting everyone’s work.</li>
                <li>If you are having difficulty with a concept, get help right away. Remember that math especially builds new material on previous material, so if you are having trouble with a concept now, you are likely to have trouble going forward. Make an appointment with your instructor, your teaching assistant, or a skilled classmate. Check with your college’s academic support office to see about a tutor. Don’t be shy about asking for a tutor—tutoring is not just for students needing remedial help; many successful students seek them out, too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Do the following during the test:</strong></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l02">
                <li>Review the entire test before you start and work the problems you feel most confident with first.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Approach each problem following three distinct steps:</p>
                    <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l03">
                        <li>Read the problem through twice: the first time to get the full concept of the question, and the second time to draw out pertinent information. After you read through the problem the first time, ask yourself, “What is this problem about?” and “What is the answer likely to look like?” The second time through, consider these questions: “What facts do I have available?” “What do I know?” “What measurable units must the answer be in?” Think about the operations and formulas you will need to use. Try to estimate a ballpark answer.</li>
                        <li>Compute your answer. First, eliminate as many unknowns as possible. You may need to use a separate formula for each unknown. Use algebraic formulas as far as you can before plugging in actual numbers; that will make it easier to cancel and combine factors. Remember that you may need two or more tries before you come up with the answer.</li>
                        <li>Check your work. Start by comparing your actual answer to the estimate you made when you first read the problem. Does your final answer sound likely? Check your arithmetic by opposite operations: use multiplication to check division and addition to check subtraction, and so on.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p04">You should consider using these three steps whenever you are working with any math problems, not just when you get problems on tests.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p05">Science tests also are often problem based, but they also generally use the scientific method. This is why science tests may require some specific strategies.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l04">
                <li>Before the test, review your lab notes as well as your class notes and assignments. Many exam questions build upon lab experience, so pay close attention to your notes, assignments, and labs. Practice describing the experimental process.</li>
                <li>Read the question carefully. What does the instructor expect you to do? Prove a hypothesis? Describe an experiment? Summarize research? Underline the words that state the objective of the question.</li>
                <li>Look carefully at all the diagrams given with the question. What do they illustrate? Why are they included with the question? Are there elements on the diagram you are expected to label?</li>
                <li>Many science questions are based on the scientific method and experimental model. When you read the test question, identify the hypothesis the problem is proposing; be prepared to describe an experimental structure to prove a hypothesis. When you check your work, make sure the hypothesis, experimental steps, and a summary of results (or expected results) are clear. Some of these elements may be part of the question, while others you may need to provide in your answer.</li>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Multiple-Choice Questions</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Read the instructions carefully to determine if there may be more than one right answer. If there are multiple right answers, does the instructor expect you to choose just one, or do you need to mark all correct options?</li>
            <li>Read each question carefully and try to answer it in your head <em class="emphasis">before</em> reading the answer options. Then consider <em class="emphasis">all</em> the options. Eliminate first the options that are clearly incorrect. Compare the remaining answers with your own answer before choosing one and marking your paper.</li>
            <li>Look for clue words that hint that certain option answers might be correct or incorrect. Absolute words like “never,” “always,” “every,” or “none” are rarely found in a correct option. Less absolute words like “usually,” “often,” or “rarely” are regularly found in correct options.</li>
            <li>Be on the lookout for the word “not” in the stem phrase and in the answer choice options; it is an easy word to miss if you are reading too quickly, but it completely changes the meaning of the possible statements.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">True-or-False Questions</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Most of the tips for multiple-choice questions apply here as well. Be particularly aware of the words “never,” “always,” “every,” “none,” and “not” because they can determine the correct answer.</li>
            <li>Answer the questions that are obvious to you first. Then go back to statements that require more thought.</li>
            <li>If the question is stated in the positive, restate it to yourself in the negative by adding the word “not” or “never.” Does the new statement sound truer or more false?</li>
            <li>If you still are unsure whether a statement is true or false and must guess, choose “true” because most tests include more true statements than false (but don’t guess if a wrong answer penalizes you more than one left blank).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Matching Columns</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Start by looking at the two columns to be matched. Is there an equal number of items in both columns? If they are not equal, do you have to match some items in the shorter column to two or more items in the longer column, or can you leave some items unmatched? Read the directions to be sure.</li>
            <li>If one column has a series of single words to be matched to phrases in the other column, read all the phrases first, then all the single words before trying to make any matches. Now go back and read each phrase and find the word that best suits the phrase.</li>
            <li>If both columns have single words to be matched, look to cut down the number of potential matches by grouping them by parts of speech (nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs, etc.).</li>
            <li>As always, start by making the matches that are obvious to you, and then work on the ones that require more thought. Mark off all items you have already used so you can easily see which words or phrases still remain to be matched.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Short Answer Questions</h2>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>Short answer questions are designed for you to recall and provide some very <em class="emphasis">specific</em> information (unlike essay questions, which also ask you to apply critical thinking to that information). When you read the question, ask yourself what exactly the instructor wants to know. Keep your answers short and <em class="emphasis">specific</em>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Essay Questions</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>Essay questions are used by instructors to evaluate your thinking and reasoning applied to the material covered in a course. Good essay answers are based on <em class="emphasis">your</em> thoughts, supported by examples from classes and reading assignments.</li>
            <li>Careful planning is critical to answering essay questions effectively. Note how many essay questions you have to answer and how difficult each question seems. Then allocate your time accordingly.</li>
            <li>Read the question carefully and underline or circle keywords. Watch for words that describe the instructor’s expectations for your response (see <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch06_s04_s05_t01">Table 6.1 "Words to Watch for in Essay Questions"</a>).</li>
            <li>If time allows, organize your thoughts by creating a quick outline for your essay. This helps ensure that you don’t leave out key points, and if you run out of time, it may pick up a few points for your grade. Jot down specific information you might want to use, such as names, dates, and places. <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch08#lochhaas-ch08">Chapter 8 "Writing for Classes"</a> discusses outlining and other aspects of the writing process in more detail.</li>
            <li>Introduce your essay answer, but get right to the point. Remember that the instructor will be grading dozens of papers and avoid “filler” text that does not add value to your answer. For example, rather than writing, “In our study of the Civil War, it is helpful to consider the many facets that lead to conflict, especially the economic factors that help explain this important turning point in our nation’s history,” write a more direct and concise statement like this: “Economic factors help explain the start of the Civil War.”</li>
            <li>Write neatly and watch your grammar and spelling. Allow time to proofread your essay. You want your instructor to want to read your essay, not dread it. Remember that grading essays is largely subjective, and a favorable impression can lead to more favorable grading.</li>
            <li>Be sure to answer all parts of the question. Essay questions often have more than one part. Remember, too, that essay questions often have multiple acceptable answers.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p01">Throughout this book we have focused on the active process of <em class="emphasis">learning</em>, not just on how to get good grades. The attitude of some students that grades are the end-all in academics has led many students to resort to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">academic dishonesty</a><span class="glossdef">Cheating or using any unauthorized or unacceptable material in academic activities such as assignments and tests; turning in work that is not your own under your name.</span></span> to try to get the best possible grades or handle the pressure of an academic program. Although you may be further tempted if you’ve heard people say, “Everybody does it,” or “It’s no big deal at my school,” you should be mindful of the consequences of cheating:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You don’t learn as much.</strong> Cheating may get you the right answer on a particular exam question, but it won’t teach you how to apply knowledge in the world after school, nor will it give you a foundation of knowledge for learning more advanced material. When you cheat, you cheat yourself out of opportunities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You risk failing the course or even expulsion from school.</strong> Each institution has its own definitions of and penalties for academic dishonesty, but most include cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication or falsification. The exact details of what is allowed or not allowed vary somewhat among different colleges and even instructors, so you should be sure to check your school’s Web site and your instructor’s guidelines to see what rules apply. Ignorance of the rules is seldom considered a valid defense.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating causes stress.</strong> Fear of getting caught will cause you stress and anxiety; this will get in the way of performing well with the information you <em class="emphasis">do</em> know.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You’re throwing away your money and time.</strong> Getting a college education is a big investment of money and effort. You’re simply not getting your full value when you cheat, because you don’t learn as much.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You are trashing your integrity.</strong> Cheating once and getting away with it makes it easier to cheat again, and the more you cheat, the more comfortable you will feel with giving up your integrity in other areas of life—with perhaps even more serious consequences.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating lowers your self-esteem.</strong> If you cheat, you are telling yourself that you are simply not smart enough to handle learning. It also robs you of the feeling of satisfaction from genuine success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p02">Technology has made it easier to cheat. Your credit card and an Internet connection can procure a paper for you on just about any subject and length. You can copy and paste for free from various Web sites. Students have made creative use of texting and video on their cell phones to gain unauthorized access to material for exams. But be aware that technology has also created ways for instructors to easily detect these forms of academic dishonesty. Most colleges make these tools available to their instructors. Instructors are also modifying their testing approaches to reduce potential academic misconduct by using methods that are harder to cheat at (such as in-class essays that evaluate <em class="emphasis">your</em> thinking and oral presentations).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p03">If you feel uneasy about doing something in your college work, trust your instincts. Confirm with the instructor that your intended form of research or use of material is acceptable. Cheating just doesn’t pay.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_l03">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating:</strong> using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regrading; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting that work under one's own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plagiarism:</strong> submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one's own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Fabrication:</strong> falsifying or inventing any information, data or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Obtaining an Unfair Advantage:</strong> (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing library materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaboration on an academic assignment; (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student's academic work; or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over other students' academic work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty:</strong> (a) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Falsification of Records and Official Documents:</strong> altering documents affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of permission, petition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official University document.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unauthorized Access</strong> to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the use or availability of computer systems or information.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lochhaas-fn06_001">Undergraduate Academic Conduct Committee of Northwestern University, “Definitions of Academic Violations,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html">http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html</a> (accessed July 13, 2010).</span>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p01">So far, we have focused on how to study for and take tests effectively. This section discusses how to <em class="emphasis">use</em> test results to their greatest benefit. Some of your most important learning begins when your graded test paper is returned to you. Your first reaction, of course, is to see what grade you received and how you did compared with your classmates. This is a natural reaction.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p02">Make sure you listen to the instructor as the papers are returned. What is the instructor saying about the test? Is there a particular point everyone had trouble with? Does the instructor generally think everyone did well? The instructor’s comments at this point may give you important information about what you should study more, about the value of review sessions, and even about possible questions for the next exam.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p03">Although you may be tempted to throw away the exam, don’t. It is a very helpful tool for the next phase of preparing for learning. This is a three-step process, beginning with evaluating your results.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluating Your Test Results</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_p01">When you receive your test back, sit quietly and take a close look at it. What questions did you get wrong? What kind of mistakes were they? (See <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_t01">Table 6.2 "Exam Errors and How to Correct Them"</a>.) Do you see a pattern? What questions did you get right? What were your strengths? What can you learn from the instructor’s comments?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_p02">Now think of the way in which you prepared for the exam and the extent to which you applied the exam strategies described earlier in this chapter. Were you prepared for the exam? Did you study the right material? What surprised you? Did you read the entire test before starting? Did your time allocation work well, or were you short of time on certain parts of the exam?</p>

Make sure you file them with your notes for the study unit. Take the time to annotate your notes based on the exam. Pay particular attention to any gaps in your notes on topics that appeared in the quiz or exam. Research those points in your text or online and complete your notes.
