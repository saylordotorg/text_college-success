    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s01_p01">So what are the various types of thinking skills, and what kind things are we doing when we apply them? In the 1950s, Benjamin Bloom developed a classification of thinking skills that is still helpful today; it is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bloom’s taxonomy</a><span class="glossdef">A classification of thinking skills developed by Benjamin Bloom. In order of increasing complexity, they are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.</span></span>. He lists six types of thinking skills, ranked in order of complexity: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "Types of Thinking Skills"</a> outlines each skill and what is involved in that type of thinking, as updated by Lorin Anderson and David Krothwohl.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lochhaas-fn03_001">L.

Krathwohl, eds., <em class="emphasis">A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives</em> (Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2001).</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s01_p02">All of these thinking skills are important for college work (and life in the “real world,” too). You’ve likely had a great deal of experience with the lower-level thinking skills (yellow section). The midlevel skills are skills you will get a lot of practice with in college, and you may be well on your way to mastering them already. The higher-level thinking skills (red section) are the most demanding, and you will need to invest focused effort to develop them.</p>

You have read about the learning cycle and the importance of <em class="emphasis">applying</em> your knowledge. You will learn tips for <em class="emphasis">remembering</em> information from your notes and classes. Preparing for class requires you to <em class="emphasis">analyze</em> what you know and what you need to learn. The sections on listening and reading will help you develop your <em class="emphasis">understanding</em> skills. Look for those tips and practice them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s01_p06">In this chapter, we will focus on critical thinking (evaluating) and creative thinking. They deserve specific focus because they are likely to be the skills you have least practice with. These are the skills most helpful for success in college and in “real life.” Creative thinking will help you come up with possible solutions for problems and new ideas. Critical thinking will help you decide which of those ideas have most merit and deserve to be implemented.</p>
