    <h3 class="title editable block">Preface</h3>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p01">Our primary goal in writing <em class="emphasis">College Success</em> is to help you succeed in college.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p02">According to Department of Education data, 30 percent of college freshmen leave school in their first year and as many as 50 percent never graduate. <em class="emphasis">College Success</em> is designed to help change that.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p03"><em class="emphasis">College Success</em> has a student-friendly format arranged to help you develop the essential skills and provide the information you need to succeed in college. This is not a textbook full of theory and extensive detail that merely <em class="emphasis">discusses</em> student success; rather, this is a how-to manual for succeeding in college. The book provides realistic, practical guidance ranging from study skills to personal health, from test taking to managing time and money. Furthermore, <em class="emphasis">College Success</em> is accessible—information is presented concisely and as simply as possible.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p04"><em class="emphasis">College Success</em> has the following features to help you achieve your goals: Each chapter asks you to evaluate yourself because success starts with recognizing your strengths and weaknesses, your hopes and desires, and your own personal, individual realities. You’ll develop your own goals based on these self-assessments, determining what success in college really means for you as an individual. Throughout the book, you will find numerous interactive activities created to help you improve your skills. To assist you with this, the material is presented in easily digestible “chunks” of information so you can begin applying it immediately in your own life—and get the most out of your college education.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p05"><em class="emphasis">College Success</em> was developed in partnership with Career Management, LLC, whose cofounders developed SuccessHawk® (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.successhawk.com">http://www.successhawk.com</a>)—interactive online job search software, designed to help you achieve your ultimate goal of landing a great job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-chpr_p06">Welcome aboard!</p>
