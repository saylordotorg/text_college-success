You soon will discover the new social structure, you may be invigorated by a new freedom, and you may be daunted by the number of options you have for activities. We cover these nonacademic aspects of college life starting in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch09#lochhaas-ch09">Chapter 9 "The Social World of College"</a>. But for now, consider some of the differences between college classes and what you likely were used to in high school. These differences are important because they demand you change your behavior if you want to be a successful student.</p>
