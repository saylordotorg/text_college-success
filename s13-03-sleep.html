Sleep is particularly important for students because there seem to be so many time pressures—to attend class, study, maintain a social life, and perhaps work—that most college students have difficulty getting enough. Yet sleep is critical for concentrating well. First, use the Sleep Self-Assessment to consider your current habits and attitudes.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Importance of a Good Night’s Sleep</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_p01">You may not realize the benefits of sleep, or the problems associated with being sleep deprived, because most likely you’ve had the same sleep habits for a long time. Or maybe you know you’re getting less sleep now, but with all the changes in your life, how can you tell if some of your stress or problems studying are related to not enough sleep?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_p02">On the positive side, a healthy amount of sleep has the following benefits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Improves your mood during the day</li>
            <li>Improves your memory and learning abilities</li>
            <li>Gives you more energy</li>
            <li>Strengthens your immune system</li>
            <li>Promotes wellness of body, mind, and spirit</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_p03">In contrast, not getting enough sleep over time can lead to a wide range of health issues and student problems. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sleep deprivation</a><span class="glossdef">A chronic lack of sufficient restorative sleep.</span></span> can have the following consequences:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>Affects mental health and contributes to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stress</a><span class="glossdef">A natural response of the body and mind to a demand or challenge, often associated with feelings of tension and negative emotions.</span></span> and feelings of anxiety, depression, and general unhappiness</li>
            <li>Causes sleepiness, difficulty paying attention in class, and ineffective studying</li>
            <li>Weakens the immune system, making it more likely to catch colds and other infections</li>
            <li>Increases the risk of accidents (such as while driving)</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Much Sleep Is Enough?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p01">College students are the most sleep-deprived population group in the country. With so much to do, who has time for sleep?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep a night, and the average is around eight. Some say they need much less than that, but often their behavior during the day shows they are actually sleep deprived. Some genuinely need only about six hours a night. New research indicates there may be a “sleep gene” that determines how much sleep a person needs. So how much sleep do <em class="emphasis">you</em> actually need?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p03">There is no simple answer, in part because the quality of sleep is just as important as the number of hours a person sleeps. Sleeping fitfully for nine hours and waking during the night is usually worse than seven or eight hours of good sleep, so you can’t simply count the hours. Do you usually feel rested and alert all day long? Do you rise from bed easily in the morning without struggling with the alarm clock? Do you have no trouble paying attention to your instructors and never feel sleepy in a lecture class? Are you not continually driven to drink more coffee or caffeine-heavy “power drinks” to stay attentive? Are you able to get through work without feeling exhausted? If you answered yes to all of these, you likely are in that 10 percent to 15 percent of college students who consistently get enough sleep.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How to Get More and Better Sleep</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p01">You have to allow yourself enough time for a good night’s sleep. Using the time management strategies discussed in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>, schedule at least eight hours for sleeping every night. If you still don’t feel alert and energetic during the day, try increasing this to nine hours. Keep a sleep journal, and within a couple weeks you’ll know how much sleep you need and will be on the road to making new habits to ensure you get it.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Exercise before bedtime is good for sleeping.</strong> <em class="emphasis">False:</em> Exercise wakes up your body, and it may be some time before you unwind and relax. Exercise earlier in the day, however, is beneficial for sleep.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">It helps to fall asleep after watching television or surfing the Web in bed.</strong> <em class="emphasis">False:</em> Rather than helping you unwind, these activities can engage your mind and make it more difficult to get to sleep.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_l02">
                <li>Avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nicotine</a><span class="glossdef">A habit-forming stimulant found in tobacco, which raises blood pressure, increases heart rate, and has toxic effects throughout the body.</span></span>, which can keep you awake—yet another reason to stop smoking.</li>
                <li>Avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">caffeine</a><span class="glossdef">A stimulant found in coffee, tea, many soft drinks, and other foods and drinks that increases alertness and wakefulness but also may have adverse effects in large quantities.</span></span> for six to eight hours before bed. Caffeine remains in the body for three to five hours on the average, much longer for some people. Remember that many soft drinks contain caffeine.</li>
                <li>Don’t eat in the two to three hours before bed. Avoid alcohol before bedtime.</li>
                <li>Don’t nap during the day. Napping is the least productive form of rest and often makes you less alert. It may also prevent you from getting a good night’s sleep.</li>
                <li>Exercise earlier in the day (at least several hours before bedtime).</li>
                <li>Try to get to bed and wake about the same time every day—your body likes a routine.</li>
                <li>Make sure the environment is conducive to sleep: dark, quiet, comfortable, and cool.</li>
                <li>Use your bed only for sleeping, not for studying, watching television, or other activities. Going to bed will become associated with going to sleep.</li>
                <li>Establish a presleep winding-down routine, such as taking a hot bath, listening to soothing music, or reading (not a textbook). Try one of the relaxation techniques described in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10_s05#lochhaas-ch10_s05">Section 10.5 "Stress"</a>.</li>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p02">If you can’t fall asleep after ten to fifteen minutes in bed, it’s better to get up and do something else rather than lie there fitfully for hours. Do something you find restful (or boring). Read, or listen to a recorded book. Go back to bed when you’re sleepy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p03">If you frequently cannot get to sleep or are often awake for a long time during the night, you may be suffering from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insomnia</a><span class="glossdef">An inability to sleep; chronic sleeplessness.</span></span>, a medical condition. Resist the temptation to try over-the-counter sleep aids. If you have tried the tips listed here and still cannot sleep, talk with your health-care provider or visit the student health clinic.
