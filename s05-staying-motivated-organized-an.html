        <h2 class="title editable block">Goals and Time Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p01">Since you’re reading this now, chances are very good you’re already in college or about to start. That means you’ve already set at least one goal for yourself—to get a college education—and that you’ve been motivated to come this far. You should feel good about that, because lots of people don’t make it this far. You’re off to a great first step!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p02">But did you know that in many colleges in the United States, almost half of first-year college students will not make it to graduation? This varies widely among different colleges. Ask your instructor if he or she knows the graduation rate at your college, or you research this topic on your own. Knowing this can be important, because peer pressure (whether to succeed or to be lax and possibly drop out later) can be an important factor in your success.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p03">If you want to be among the students who do succeed, it’s important to accept that college is not easy for most students. But we’re not trying to scare or depress you! The evidence shows that the huge majority of those who really want to finish college can do so successfully, if they stay motivated and learn how to succeed. That’s what this book is all about. But it may take some effort. Succeeding in college involves paying attention to your studies in ways you may not have had to in your former life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p04">The two most common reasons why students drop out are financial difficulties and falling behind in studying. While no one is guaranteed to easily find the money needed for college, there are many ways you can cut costs and make it easier to get through. <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a> has lots of tips for how to make it financially.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p05">This chapter looks at the other big issue: how to make sure that you succeed in your courses. The first step is to be committed to your education. You’ve been motivated to start college—now you need to keep that motivation going as you target specific goals for success in your classes. Much of this has to do with attitude. Success also requires managing your time effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s00_p06">In fact, time management skills can make the difference between those who graduate from college and those who drop out. Time management is actually all about managing yourself: knowing what you want, deciding how to get what you want, and then efficiently and effectively getting it. That applies to fun things, too. In fact, you may want to think of the goal of this chapter as not just managing your time for studying but ensuring that even as you do well in your studies, you’re still enjoying your life while in college!</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p01">Some people are goal oriented and seem to easily make decisions that lead to achieving their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">goals</a><span class="glossdef">A result or achievement toward which one directs one’s efforts.</span></span>, while others seem just to “go with the flow” and accept what life gives them. While the latter may sound pleasantly relaxed, moving through life without goals may not lead anywhere at all. The fact that you’re in college now shows you already have the major goal to complete your college program.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p02">A goal is a result we intend to reach mostly through our own actions. Things we do may move us closer to or farther away from that result. Studying moves us closer to success in a difficult course, while sleeping through the final examination may completely prevent reaching that goal. That’s fairly obvious in an extreme case, yet still a lot of college students don’t reach their goal of graduating. The problem may be a lack of commitment to the goal, but often students have conflicting goals. One way to prevent problems is to think about all your goals and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">priorities</a><span class="glossdef">Something that is more important than other things or given special attention.</span></span> and to learn ways to manage your time, your studies, and your social life to best reach your goals. Consider these four students:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p03">To help his widowed mother, Juan went to work full time after high school but now, a few years later, he’s dissatisfied with the kinds of jobs he has been able to get and has begun taking computer programming courses in the evening. He’s often tired after work, however, and his mother would like him to spend more time at home. Sometimes he cuts class to stay home and spend time with her.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p04">In her senior year of college, Becky has just been elected president of her sorority and is excited about planning a major community service project. She knows she should be spending more time on her senior thesis, but she feels her community project may gain her contacts that can help her find a better job after graduation. Besides, the sorority project is a lot more fun, and she’s enjoying the esteem of her position. Even if she doesn’t do well on her thesis, she’s sure she’ll pass.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_bl03">
        <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p05">After an easy time in high school, James is surprised his college classes are so hard. He’s got enough time to study for his first-year courses, but he also has a lot of friends and fun things to do. Sometimes he’s surprised to look up from his computer to see it’s midnight already, and he hasn’t started reading that chapter yet. Where does the time go? When he’s stressed, however, he can’t study well, so he tells himself he’ll get up early and read the chapter before class, and then he turns back to his computer to see who’s online.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_bl04">
        <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p06">Sachito was successful in cutting back her hours at work to give her more time for her engineering classes, but it’s difficult for her to get much studying done at home. Her husband has been wonderful about taking care of their young daughter, but he can’t do everything, and lately he’s been hinting more about asking her sister to babysit so that the two of them can go out in the evening the way they used to. Lately, when she’s had to study on a weekend, he leaves with his friends, and Sachito ends up spending the day with her daughter—and not getting much studying done.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p07">What do these very different students have in common? Each has goals that conflict in one or more ways. Each needs to develop strategies to meet their other goals without threatening their academic success. And all of them have time management issues to work through: three because they feel they don’t have enough time to do everything they want or need to do and one because even though he has enough time, he needs to learn how to manage it more effectively. For all four of them, motivation and attitude will be important as they develop strategies to achieve their goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p08">It all begins with setting goals and thinking about priorities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p09">As you think about your own goals, think about more than just being a student. You’re also a person with individual needs and desires, hopes and dreams, plans and schemes. Your long-term goals likely include graduation and a career but may also involve social relationships with others, a romantic relationship, family, hobbies or other activities, where and how you live, and so on. While you are a student you may not be actively pursuing all your goals with the same fervor, but they remain goals and are still important in your life.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p10">Goals also vary in terms of time. Short-term goals focus on today and the next few days and perhaps weeks. Midterm goals involve plans for this school year and the time you plan to remain in college. Long-term goals may begin with graduating college and everything you want to happen thereafter. Often your long-term goals (e.g., the kind of career you want) guide your midterm goals (getting the right education for that career), and your short-term goals (such as doing well on an exam) become steps for reaching those larger goals. Thinking about your goals in this way helps you realize how even the little things you do every day can keep you moving toward your most important long-term goals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_p11">Write out your goals in Activity 1. You should literally <em class="emphasis">write</em> them down, because the act of finding the best words to describe your goals helps you think more clearly about them. Follow these guidelines:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Goals should be realistic.</strong> It’s good to dream and to challenge yourself, but your goals should relate to your personal strengths and abilities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Goals should be specific.</strong> Don’t write, “I will become a great musician”; instead, write, “I will finish my music degree and be employed in a symphony orchestra.”</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Goals should have a time frame.</strong> You won’t feel very motivated if your goal is vaguely “to finish college someday.” If you’re realistic and specific in your goals, you should also be able to project a time frame for reaching the goal.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You should really want to reach the goal.</strong> We’re willing to work hard to reach goals we really care about, but we’re likely to give up when we encounter obstacles if we don’t feel strongly about a goal. If you’re doing something only because your parents or someone else wants you to, then it’s not your own personal goal—and you may have some more thinking to do about your life.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Priorities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Thinking about your goals gets you started, but it’s also important to think about priorities. We often use the word “priorities” to refer to how important something is to us. We might think, <em class="emphasis">This</em> is a really important goal, and <em class="emphasis">that</em> is less important. Try this experiment: go back to the goals you wrote in Activity 1 and see if you can rank each goal as a 1 (top priority), 2 (middle priority), or 3 (lowest priority).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s01_p02">It sounds easy, but do you actually feel comfortable doing that? Maybe you gave a priority 1 to passing your courses and a priority 3 to playing your guitar. So what does that mean—that you never play guitar again, or at least not while in college? Whenever you have an hour free between class and work, you have to study because that’s the higher priority? What about all your other goals—do you have to ignore everything that’s not a priority 1? And what happens when you have to choose among different goals that are both number 1 priorities?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s01_p03">In reality, priorities don’t work quite that way. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to try to rank goals as <em class="emphasis">always</em> more or less important. The question of priority is really a question of what is more important <em class="emphasis">at a specific time.</em> It is important to do well in your classes, but it’s also important to have a social life and enjoy your time off from studying. You shouldn’t have to choose between the two—except <em class="emphasis">at any given time</em>. Priorities always involve time: what is most important to do <em class="emphasis">right now</em>. As we’ll see later, time management is mostly a way to juggle priorities so you can meet all your goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s01_p04">When you manage your time well, you don’t have to ignore some goals completely in order to meet other goals. In other words, you don’t have to give up your life when you register for college—but you may need to work on managing your life more effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s01_p05">But time management works only when you’re committed to your goals. Attitude and motivation are very important. If you haven’t yet developed an attitude for success, all the time management skills in the world won’t keep you focused and motivated to succeed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">An Attitude for Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p01">What’s your attitude <em class="emphasis">right now</em>—what started running through your mind as you saw the “An Attitude for Success” heading? Were you groaning to yourself, thinking, “No, not the attitude thing again!” Or, at the other extreme, maybe you were thinking, “This is great! Now I’m about to learn everything I need to get through college without a problem!” Those are two attitude extremes, one negative and skeptical, the other positive and hopeful. Most students are somewhere in between—but <em class="emphasis">everyone</em> has an attitude of one sort or another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Everything people do and how they do it starts with attitude. One student gets up with the alarm clock and cheerfully prepares for the day, planning to study for a couple hours between classes, go jogging later, and see a friend at dinner. Another student oversleeps after partying too late last night, decides to skip his first class, somehow gets through later classes fueled by fast food and energy drinks while dreading tomorrow’s exam, and immediately accepts a friend’s suggestion to go out tonight instead of studying. Both students could have identical situations, classes, finances, and academic preparation. There could be just one significant difference—but it’s the one that matters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p03">Here are some characteristics associated with a positive attitude:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Enthusiasm for and enjoyment of daily activities</li>
            <li>Acceptance of responsibility for one’s actions and feeling good about success</li>
            <li>Generally upbeat mood and positive emotions, cheerfulness with others, and satisfaction with oneself</li>
            <li>Motivation to get the job done</li>
            <li>Flexibility to make changes when needed</li>
            <li>Ability to make productive, effective use of time</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p04">And here are some characteristics associated with a negative attitude:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_l02">
            <li>Frequent complaining</li>
            <li>Blaming others for anything that goes wrong</li>
            <li>Often experiencing negative emotions: anger, depression, resentment</li>
            <li>Lack of motivation for work or studies</li>
            <li>Hesitant to change or seek improvement</li>
            <li>Unproductive use of time, procrastination</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p05">We started this chapter talking about goals, because people’s goals and priorities have a huge effect on their attitude. Someone who really wants to succeed in college is better motivated and can develop a more positive attitude to succeed. But what if you are committed to succeeding in college but still feel kind of doubtful or worried or even down on yourself—what can you do then? Can people really change their attitude? Aren’t people just “naturally” positive or negative or whatever?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_p06">While attitude is influenced by one’s personality, upbringing, and past experiences, there is no “attitude gene” that makes you one way or another. It’s not as simple as taking a pill, but attitude can be changed. If you’re committed to your goals, you can learn to adjust your attitude. The following are some things you can start doing.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Be More Upbeat with Yourself</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s01_p01">We all have conversations with ourselves. I might do badly on a test, and I start thinking things like, “I’m just not smart enough” or “That teacher is so hard no one could pass that test.” The problem when we talk to ourselves this way is that we listen—and we start believing what we’re hearing. Think about what you’ve been saying to yourself since your first day at college. Have you been negative or making excuses, maybe because you’re afraid of not succeeding? You <em class="emphasis">are</em> smart enough or you wouldn’t be here. Even if you did poorly on a test, you can turn that around into a more positive attitude by taking responsibility. “OK, I goofed off too much when I should have been studying. I learned my lesson—now it’s time to buckle down and study for the next test. I’m going to ace this one!” Hear yourself saying that enough and guess what—you soon find out you <em class="emphasis">can</em> succeed even in your hardest classes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Choose Whom You Spend Time With</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p01">We all know negative and positive people. Sometimes it’s fun to hang out with someone with a negative attitude, especially if their sarcasm is funny. And if we’ve just failed a test, we might enjoy being with someone else who also blames the instructor or “the system” for whatever goes wrong. As they say, misery loves company. But often being with negative people is one of the surest ways to stay negative yourself. You not only hear your own self-talk making excuses and blaming others and putting yourself down, but you hear other people saying it, too. After a while you’re convinced it’s true. You’ve developed a negative attitude that sets you up for failure.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s02_p02">College offers a great opportunity to make new friends. Friendships and other social relationships are important to all humans—and maybe to college students most of all, because of the stresses of college and the changes you’re likely experiencing. Later chapters in this book have some tips for making new friends and getting actively involved in campus life, if you’re not already there. Most important, try to choose friends with a positive attitude. It’s simply more fun to be with people who are upbeat and enjoying life, people whom you respect—and who, like you, are committed to their studies and are motivated. A positive attitude can really be contagious.</p>

        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Overcome Resistance to Change</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s03_p01">While it’s true that most people are more comfortable when their situation is not always changing, many kinds of change are good and should be welcomed. College is a big change from high school or working. Accepting that reality helps you be more positive about the differences. Sure, you have to study more, and the classes are harder. You may be working more and have less time for your personal life. But dwelling on those differences only reinforces a negative attitude. Look instead at the positive changes: the exciting and interesting people you’re meeting, the education you’re getting that will lead to a bright future, and the mental challenges and stimulation you’re feeling every day.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s03_p02">The first step may be simply to see yourself succeeding in your new life. Visualize yourself as a student taking control, enjoying classes, studying effectively, getting good grades. This book will help you do that in many ways. It all begins with the right attitude.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Overcome Fears</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s04_p01">One of the most common fears of college students is a fear of failure—of not being able to make the grade. We all know that life is not all roses and that we’re not going to succeed at everything we try. Everyone experiences some sort of failure at some time—and everyone has fears. The question is what you do about it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s02_s04_p02">Again, think about your goals. You’ve enrolled in college for good reasons, and you’ve already shown your commitment by coming this far. If you still have any fear of failure, turn it around and use it in a positive way. If you’re afraid you may not do well on an upcoming exam, don’t mope around—sit down and schedule times to start studying well ahead of time. It’s mostly a matter of attitude adjustment.</p>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Stay Focused and Motivated</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03_p01">Okay, you’ve got a positive attitude. But you’ve got a lot of reading for classes to do tonight, a test tomorrow, and a paper due the next day. Maybe you’re a little bored with one of your reading assignments. Maybe you’d rather play a computer game. Uh oh—now what? Attitude can change at almost any moment. One minute you’re enthusiastically starting a class project, and then maybe a friend drops by and suddenly all you want to do is close the books and relax a while, hang out with friends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03_p02">One of the characteristics of successful people is accepting that life is full of interruptions and change—and planning for it. Staying focused does not mean you become a boring person who does nothing but go to class and study all the time. You just need to make a plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03_p03">Planning ahead is the single best way to stay focused and motivated to reach your goals. Don’t wait until the night before an exam. If you know you have a major exam in five days, start by reviewing the material and deciding how many hours of study you need. Then schedule those hours spread out over the next few days—at times when you are most alert and least likely to be distracted. Allow time for other activities, too, to reward yourself for successful studying. Then when the exam comes, you’re relaxed, you know the material, you’re in a good mood and confident, and you do well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03_p04">Planning is mostly a matter of managing your time well, as we’ll see later. Here are some other tips for staying focused and motivated:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>If you’re not feeling motivated, think about the results of your goals, not just the goals themselves. If just thinking about finishing college doesn’t sound all that exciting, then think instead about the great, high-paying career that comes afterward and the things you can do with that income.</li>
            <li>Say it aloud—to yourself or a friend with a positive attitude: “I’m going to study now for another hour before I take a break—and I’m getting an A on that test tomorrow!” It’s amazing how saying something aloud puts commitment in it and affirms that it can be true.</li>
            <li>Remember your successes, even small successes. As you begin a project or approach studying for a test, think about your past success on a different project or test. Remember how good it feels to succeed. Know you can succeed again.</li>
            <li>Focus on the here and now. For some people, looking ahead to goals, or to anything else, may lead to daydreaming that keeps them from focusing on what they need to do right now. Don’t worry about what you’re doing tomorrow or next week or month. If your mind keeps drifting off, however, you may need to reward or even trick yourself to focus on the here and now. For example, if you can’t stop thinking about the snack you’re going to have when you finish studying in a couple hours, change the plan. Tell yourself you’ll take a break in twenty minutes if you really need it—but only if you really work well first.</li>
            <li>If you just can’t focus in on what you should be doing because the task seems too big and daunting, break the task into smaller, manageable pieces. Don’t start out thinking, “I need to study the next four hours,” but think, “I’ll spend the next thirty minutes going through my class notes from the last three weeks and figure out what topics I need to spend more time on.” It’s a lot easier to stay focused when you’re sitting down for thirty minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>Never, ever multitask while studying! You may think that you can monitor e-mail and send text messages while studying, but in reality, these other activities lower the quality of your studying.</li>
            <li>Imitate successful people. Does a friend always seem better able to stick with studying or work until they get it done? What are they doing that you’re not? We all learn from observing others, and we can speed up that process by deliberately using the same strategies we see working with others. <em class="emphasis">Visualize yourself</em> studying in the same way and getting that same high grade on the test or paper.</li>
            <li>Separate yourself from unsuccessful people. This is the flip side of imitating successful people. If a roommate or a friend is always putting off things until the last minute or is distracted with other interests and activities, tell yourself how different you are. When you hear other students complaining about how hard a class is or bragging about not studying or attending class, visualize yourself as not being like them at all.</li>
            <li>Reward yourself when you complete a significant task—but only when you are done. Some people seem able to stay focused only when there’s a reward waiting.</li>
            <li>While some people work harder for the reward, others are motivated more by the price of failing. While some people are almost paralyzed by anxiety, others are moved by their fear to achieve their best.</li>
            <li>Get the important things done first. We’ll talk about managing your academic planner and to-do lists later in the chapter, but for now, to stay focused and motivated, concentrate on the things that matter most. You’re about to sit down to read a chapter in a book you’re not much enjoying, and you suddenly notice some clothing piled up on a chair. “I really should clean up this place,” you think. “And I’d better get my laundry done before I run out of things to wear.” Don’t try to fool yourself into feeling you’re accomplishing something by doing laundry rather than studying. Stay focused!</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Network for Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04_p01">Making friends with people with positive attitudes not only helps you maintain a positive attitude yourself, but it gets you started networking with other students in ways that will help you succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04_p02">Did you study alone or with friends in high school? Because college classes are typically much more challenging, many college students discover they do better, and find it much more enjoyable, if they study with other students taking same course. This might mean organizing a study group or just getting together with a friend to review material before a test. It’s good to start thinking right away about networking with other students in your classes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04_p03">If you consider yourself an independent person and prefer studying and doing projects on your own rather than with others, think for a minute about how most people function in their careers and professions, what the business world is like. Most work today is done by teams or individuals working together in a collaborative way. Very few jobs involve a person always being and working alone. The more you learn to study and work with other students now, the more skills you are mastering for a successful career.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04_p04">Studying with other students has immediate benefits. You can quiz each other to help ensure that everyone understands the course material; if you’re not clear about something, someone else can help teach it to you. You can read and respond to each other’s writing and other work. You can divide up the work in group projects. And through it all, you can often have more fun than if you were doing it on your own.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s04_p05">Studying together is also a great way to start networking—a topic we’ll discuss more in coming chapters. Networking has many potential benefits for your future. College students who feel they are part of a network on campus are more motivated and more successful in college.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Problem Solving: When Setbacks Happen</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p01">Even when you have clear goals and are motivated and focused to achieve them, problems sometimes happen. Accept that they <em class="emphasis">will</em> happen, since inevitably they do for everyone. The difference between those who succeed by solving the problem and moving on and those who get frustrated and give up is partly attitude and partly experience—and knowing how to cope when a problem occurs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p02">Lots of different kinds of setbacks may happen while you’re in college—just as to everyone in life. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>A financial crisis</li>
            <li>An illness or injury</li>
            <li>A crisis involving family members or loved ones</li>
            <li>Stress related to frequently feeling you don’t have enough time</li>
            <li>Stress related to relationship problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p03">Some things happen that we cannot prevent—such as some kinds of illness, losing one’s job because of a business slowdown, or crises involving family members. But many other kinds of problems can be prevented or made less likely to occur. You can take steps to stay healthy, as you’ll learn in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>. You can take control of your finances and avoid most financial problems common among college students, as you’ll learn in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a>. You can learn how to build successful social relationships and get along better with your instructors, with other students, and in personal relationships. You can learn time management techniques to ensure you use your time effectively for studying. Most of the chapters in this book also provide study tips and guidelines to help you do well in your classes with effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and writing skills for classes. <em class="emphasis">Preventing</em> the problems that typically keep college students from succeeding is much of what this book is all about.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p04">Not all problems can be avoided. Illness or a financial problem can significantly set one back—especially when you’re on a tight schedule and budget. Other problems, such as a social or relationship issue or an academic problem in a certain class, may be more complex and not easily prevented. What then?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p05">First, work to resolve the immediate problem:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_l02">
            <li>Stay motivated and focused. Don’t let frustration, anxiety, or other negative emotions make the problem worse than it already is.</li>
            <li>Analyze the problem to consider all possible solutions. An unexpected financial setback doesn’t automatically mean you have to drop out of school—not when alternatives such as student loans, less expensive living arrangements, or other possible solutions may be available. Failing a midterm exam doesn’t automatically mean you’re going to fail the course—not when you make the effort to determine what went wrong, work with your instructor and others on an improved study plan, and use better strategies to prepare for the next test.</li>
            <li>Seek help when you need to. None of us gets through life alone, and it’s not a sign of weakness to see your academic advisor or a college counselor if you have a problem.</li>
            <li>When you’ve developed a plan for resolving the problem, work to follow through. If it will take a while before the problem is completely solved, track your progress in smaller steps so that you can see you really are succeeding. Every day will move you one step closer to putting it behind you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_p06">After you’ve solved a problem, be sure to avoid it again in the future:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s01_s05_l03">
            <li>Be honest with yourself: how did you contribute to the problem? Sometimes it’s obvious: a student who drank heavily at a party the night before a big test failed the exam because he was so hung over he couldn’t think straight. Sometimes the source of the problem is not as obvious but may become clearer the more you think about it. Another student did a lot of partying during the term but studied all day before the big test and was well rested and clearheaded at test time but still did poorly; he may not yet have learned good study skills. Another student has frequent colds and other mild illnesses that keep him from doing his best: how much better would he feel if he ate well, got plenty of exercise, and slept enough every night? If you don’t honestly explore the factors that led to the problem, it’s more likely to happen again.</li>
            <li>Take responsibility for your life and your role in what happens to you. Earlier we talked about people with negative attitudes, who are always blaming others, fate, or “the system” for their problems. It’s no coincidence that they keep on having problems. Unless you <em class="emphasis">want</em> to keep having problems, don’t keep blaming others.</li>
            <li>Taking responsibility doesn’t mean being down on yourself. Failing at something doesn’t mean <em class="emphasis">you</em> are a failure. We all fail at something, sometime. Adjust your attitude so you’re ready to get back on track and feel happy that you’ll never make that mistake again!</li>
            <li>Make a plan. You might still have a problem on that next big test if you don’t make an effective study plan and stick to it. You may need to change your behavior in some way, such as learning time management strategies. (Read on!)</li>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_l01">
            <li>Recognize the importance of organizing your space to your best advantage for studying.</li>
            <li>Avoid distractions in the space where you are studying.</li>
            <li>Understand the myth of multitasking and prevent distractions from your personal technology.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_p01">Now that you’ve worked up an attitude for success and are feeling motivated, it’s time to get organized. You need to organize both your space and your time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_p02">Space is important for many reasons—some obvious, some less so. People’s moods, attitudes, and levels of work productivity change in different spaces. Learning to use space to your own advantage helps get you off to a good start in your studies. Here are a few of the ways space matters:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Everyone needs his or her own space.</strong> This may seem simple, but everyone needs some physical area, regardless of size, that is really his or her own—even if it’s only a small part of a shared space. Within your own space, you generally feel more secure and in control.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Physical space reinforces habits.</strong> For example, using your bed primarily for sleeping makes it easier to fall asleep there than elsewhere and also makes it not a good place to try to stay awake and alert for studying.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Different places create different moods.</strong> While this may seem obvious, students don’t always use places to their best advantage. One place may be bright and full of energy, with happy students passing through and enjoying themselves—a place that puts you in a good mood. But that may actually make it more difficult to concentrate on your studying. Yet the opposite—a totally quiet, austere place devoid of color and sound and pleasant decorations—can be just as unproductive if it makes you associate studying with something unpleasant. Everyone needs to discover what space works best for himself or herself—and then let that space reinforce good study habits.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Use Space to Your Advantage and to Avoid Distractions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s01_p01">Begin by analyzing your needs, preferences, and past problems with places for studying. Where do you usually study? What are the best things about that place for studying? What distractions are most likely to occur there?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s01_p02">The goal is to find, or create, the best place for studying, and then to use it regularly so that studying there becomes a good habit.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose a place you can associate with studying.</strong> Make sure it’s not a place already associated with other activities (eating, watching television, sleeping, etc.). Over time, the more often you study in this space, the stronger will be its association with studying, so that eventually you’ll be completely focused as soon as you reach that place and begin.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your study area should be available whenever you need it.</strong> If you want to use your home, apartment, or dorm room but you never know if another person may be there and possibly distract you, then it’s probably better to look for another place, such as a study lounge or an area in the library. Look for locations open at the hours when you may be studying. You may also need two study spaces—one in or near where you live, another on campus. Maybe you study best at home but have an hour free between two classes, and the library is too far away to use for only an hour? Look for a convenient empty classroom.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s01_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your study space should meet your study needs.</strong> An open desk or table surface usually works best for writing, and you’ll tire quickly if you try to write notes sitting in an easy chair (which might also make you sleepy). You need good light for reading, to avoid tiring from eyestrain. If you use a laptop for writing notes or reading and researching, you need a power outlet so you don’t have to stop when your battery runs out.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your study space should meet your psychological needs.</strong> Some students may need total silence with absolutely no visual distractions; they may find a perfect study carrel hidden away on the fifth floor in the library. Other students may be unable to concentrate for long without looking up from reading and momentarily letting their eyes move over a pleasant scene. Some students may find it easier to stay motivated when surrounded by other students also studying; they may find an open space in the library or a study lounge with many tables spread out over an area. Experiment to find the setting that works best for you—and remember that the more often you use <em class="emphasis">this same space</em>, the more comfortable and effective your studying will become.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You may need the support of others to maintain your study space.</strong> Students living at home, whether with a spouse and children or with their parents, often need the support of family members to maintain an effective study space. The kitchen table probably isn’t best if others pass by frequently. Be creative, if necessary, and set up a card table in a quiet corner of your bedroom or elsewhere to avoid interruptions. Put a “do not disturb” sign on your door.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your space organized and free of distractions.</strong> You want to prevent sudden impulses to neaten up the area (when you should be studying), do laundry, wash dishes, and so on. Unplug a nearby telephone, turn off your cell phone, and use your computer only as needed for studying. If your e-mail or message program pops up a notice every time an e-mail or message arrives, turn off your Wi-Fi or detach the network cable to prevent those intrusions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plan for breaks.</strong> Everyone needs to take a break occasionally when studying. Think about the space you’re in and how to use it when you need a break. If in your home, stop and do a few exercises to get your blood flowing. If in the library, take a walk up a couple flights of stairs and around the stacks before returning to your study area.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prepare for human interruptions.</strong> Even if you hide in the library to study, there’s a chance a friend may happen by. At home with family members or in a dorm room or common space, the odds increase greatly. Have a plan ready in case someone pops in and asks you to join them in some fun activity. Know when you plan to finish your studying so that you can make a plan for later—or for tomorrow at a set time.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Distractions of Technology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Multitasking</a><span class="glossdef">The performing of multiple tasks at the same time, often involving technology and communications. The term originates in computer science, referring to how a computer’s CPU can be programmed to function. (Importantly, the human brain does not function the same as a computer!)</span></span> is the term commonly used for being engaged in two or more different activities at the same time, usually referring to activities using devices such as cell phones, smartphones, computers, and so on. Many people claim to be able to do as many as four or five things simultaneously, such as writing an e-mail while responding to an instant message (IM) and reading a tweet, all while watching a video on their computer monitor or talking on the phone. Many people who have grown up with computers consider this kind of multitasking a normal way to get things done, including studying. Even people in business sometimes speak of multitasking as an essential component of today’s fast-paced world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p02">It is true that <em class="emphasis">some</em> things can be attended to while you’re doing something else, such as checking e-mail while you watch television news—but only when none of those things demands your full attention. You can concentrate 80 percent on the e-mail, for example, while 20 percent of your attention is listening for something on the news that catches your attention. Then you turn to the television for a minute, watch that segment, and go back to the e-mail. But you’re not actually watching the television <em class="emphasis">at the same time</em> you’re composing the e-mail—you’re rapidly going back and forth. In reality, the mind can focus only on one thing at any given moment. Even things that don’t require much thinking are severely impacted by multitasking, such as driving while talking on a cell phone or texting. An astonishing number of people end up in the emergency room from just trying to walk down the sidewalk while texting, so common is it now to walk into a pole or parked car while multitasking!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p03">“Okay,” you might be thinking, “why should it matter if I write my paper first and then answer e-mails or do them back and forth at the same time?” <strong class="emphasis bold">It actually takes you longer to do two or more things at the same time than if you do them separately</strong>—at least with anything that you actually have to focus on, such as studying. That’s true because each time you go back to studying after looking away to a message or tweet, it takes time for your mind to shift gears to get back to where you were. Every time your attention shifts, add up some more “downtime”—and pretty soon it’s evident that multitasking is costing you a lot more time than you think. And that’s assuming that your mind <em class="emphasis">does</em> fully shift back to where you were every time, without losing your train of thought or forgetting an important detail. It doesn’t always.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p04">The other problem with multitasking is the effect it can have on the attention span—and even on how the brain works. Scientists have shown that in people who constantly shift their attention from one thing to another in short bursts, the brain forms patterns that make it more difficult to keep sustained attention on any one thing. So when you really do need to concentrate for a while on one thing, such as when studying for a big test, it becomes more difficult to do even if you’re not multitasking at that time. It’s as if your mind makes a habit of wandering from one thing to another and then can’t stop.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p05">So stay away from multitasking whenever you have something important to do, like studying. If it’s already a habit for you, don’t let it become worse. Manipulate your study space to prevent the temptations altogether. Turn your computer off—or shut down e-mail and messaging programs if you need the computer for studying. Turn your cell phone off—if you just tell yourself not to answer it but still glance at it each time to see who sent or left a message, you’re still losing your studying momentum and have to start over again. For those who are really addicted to technology (you know who you are!), go to the library and don’t take your laptop or cell phone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p06">In the later section in this chapter on scheduling your study periods, we recommend scheduling breaks as well, usually for a few minutes every hour. If you’re really hooked on checking for messages, plan to do that at scheduled times.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s02_p07">What about listening to music while studying? Some don’t consider that multitasking, and many students say they can listen to music without it affecting their studying. Studies are inconclusive about the positive or negative effects of music on people’s ability to concentrate, probably because so many different factors are involved. But there’s a huge difference between listening to your favorite CD and spontaneously singing along with some of the songs and enjoying soft background music that enhances your study space the same way as good lighting and pleasant décor. Some people can study better with low-volume instrumental music that relaxes them and does not intrude on their thinking, while others can concentrate only in silence. And some are so used to being immersed in music and the sounds of life that they find <em class="emphasis">total</em> silence more distracting—such people can often study well in places where people are moving around. The key thing is to be honest with yourself: if you’re <em class="emphasis">actively</em> listening to music while you’re studying, then you’re likely not studying as well as you could be. It will take you longer and lead to less successful results.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Family and Roommate Issues</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s03_p01">Sometimes going to the library or elsewhere is not practical for studying, and you have to find a way to cope in a shared space.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s03_p02">Part of the solution is time management. Agree with others on certain times that will be reserved for studying; agree to keep the place quiet, not to have guests visiting, and to prevent other distractions. These arrangements can be made with a roommate, spouse, and older children. If there are younger children in your household and you have child-care responsibility, it’s usually more complicated. You may have to schedule your studying during their nap time or find quiet activities for them to enjoy while you study. Try to spend some time with your kids before you study, so they don’t feel like you’re ignoring them. (More tips are offered later in this chapter.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s03_p03">The key is to plan ahead. You don’t want to find yourself, the night before an exam, in a place that offers no space for studying.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s02_s03_p04">Finally, accept that sometimes you’ll just have to say no. If your roommate or a friend often tries to engage you in conversation or suggests doing something else when you need to study, just say no. Learn to be firm but polite as you explain that you just <em class="emphasis">really</em> have to get your work done first. Students who live at home may also have to learn how to say no to parents or family members—just be sure to explain the importance of the studying you need to do! Remember, you can’t be everything to everyone all the time.</p>

            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p03">Now use your calculator to total your estimated hours. Is your number larger or smaller than 168, the total number of hours in a week? If your estimate is higher, go back through your list and adjust numbers to be more realistic. But if your estimated hours total fewer than 168, don’t just go back and add more time in certain categories. Instead, ponder this question: <em class="emphasis">Where does the time go?</em> We’ll come back to this question.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p04">Think about your time analysis in Activity 2. People who estimate too high often feel they don’t have enough time. They may have time anxiety and often feel frustrated. People at the other extreme, who often can’t account for how they use all their time, may have a more relaxed attitude. They may not actually have any more free time, but they may be wasting more time than they want to admit with less important things. Yet they still may complain about how much time they spend studying, as if there’s a shortage of time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p05">People also differ in how they respond to schedule changes. Some go with the flow and accept changes easily, while others function well only when following a planned schedule and may become upset if that schedule changes. If you do not react well to an unexpected disruption in your schedule, plan extra time for catching up if something throws you off. This is all part of understanding your time personality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p06">Another aspect of your time personality involves time of day. If you need to concentrate, such as when writing a class paper, are you more alert and focused in the morning, afternoon, or evening? Do you concentrate best when you look forward to a relaxing activity later on, or do you study better when you’ve finished all other activities? Do you function well if you get up early—or stay up late—to accomplish a task? How does that affect the rest of your day or the next day? Understanding this will help you better plan your study periods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p07">While you may not be able to change your “time personality,” you can learn to manage your time more successfully. The key is to be realistic. How accurate is the number of hours you wrote down in Activity 2? The best way to know how you spend your time is to record what you do all day in a time log, every day for a week, and then add that up. Make copies of the time log in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_f01">Figure 2.4 "Daily Time Log"</a> and carry it with you. Every so often, fill in what you have been doing. Do this for a week before adding up the times; then enter the total hours in the categories in Activity 2. You might be surprised that you spend a lot more time than you thought just hanging out with friends—or surfing the Web or playing around with Facebook or any of the many other things people do. You might find that you study well early in the morning even though you thought you are a night person, or vice versa. You might learn how long you can continue at a specific task before needing a break.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_p08">If you have work and family responsibilities, you may already know where many of your hours go. Although we all wish we had “more time,” the important thing is what we do with the time we have. Time management strategies can help us better use the time we do have by creating a schedule that works for our own time personality.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p01">Time management for successful college studying involves these factors:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Determining how much time you need to spend studying</li>
            <li>Knowing how much time you actually have for studying and increasing that time if needed</li>
            <li>Being aware of the times of day you are at your best and most focused</li>
            <li>Using effective long- and short-term study strategies</li>
            <li>Scheduling study activities in realistic segments</li>
            <li>Using a system to plan ahead and set priorities</li>
            <li>Staying motivated to follow your plan and avoid procrastination</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p02">For every hour in the classroom, college students should spend, on average, about two hours on that class, counting reading, studying, writing papers, and so on. If you’re a full-time student with fifteen hours a week in class, then you need another thirty hours for rest of your academic work. That forty-five hours is about the same as a typical full-time job. If you work part time, time management skills are even more essential. These skills are still more important for part-time college students who work full time and commute or have a family. To succeed in college, virtually everyone has to develop effective strategies for dealing with time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Look back at the number of hours you wrote in Activity 2 for a week of studying. Do you have two hours of study time for every hour in class? Many students begin college not knowing this much time is needed, so don’t be surprised if you underestimated this number of hours. Remember this is just an average amount of study time—you may need more or less for your own courses. To be safe, and to help ensure your success, add another five to ten hours a week for studying.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p04">To reserve this study time, you may need to adjust how much time you spend in other activities. Activity 3 will help you figure out what your typical week should look like.</p>

Use the time log in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch02_s03_s01_f01">Figure 2.4 "Daily Time Log"</a> to determine if you really have to spend that much time on those things.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p08">Activity 3 shows most college students that they do actually have plenty of time for their studies without losing sleep or giving up their social life. But you may have less time for discretionary activities than in the past. <em class="emphasis">Something, somewhere has to give.</em> That’s part of time management—and why it’s important to keep your goals and priorities in mind. The other part is to learn how to use the hours you do have as effectively as possible, especially the study hours. For example, if you’re a typical college freshman who plans to study for three hours in an evening but then <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">procrastinates</a><span class="glossdef">To intentionally (often habitually) put something off until another day or time.</span></span>, gets caught up in a conversation, loses time to checking e-mail and text messages, and listens to loud music while reading a textbook, then maybe you actually spent four hours “studying” but got only two hours of actual work done. So you end up behind and feeling like you’re still studying way too much. The goal of time management is to actually get three hours of studying done in three hours and have time for your life as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Special note for students who work.</strong> You may have almost <em class="emphasis">no</em> discretionary time at all left in Activity 3 after all your “must-do” activities. If so, you may have overextended yourself—a situation that inevitably will lead to problems. You can’t sleep two hours less every night for the whole school year, for example, without becoming ill or unable to concentrate well on work and school. It is better to recognize this situation now rather than set yourself up for a very difficult term and possible failure. If you cannot cut the number of hours for work or other obligations, see your academic advisor right away. It is better to take fewer classes and succeed than to take more classes than you have time for and risk failure.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management Strategies for Success</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_s01_p01">Following are some strategies you can begin using immediately to make the most of your time:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prepare to be successful.</strong> When planning ahead for studying, think yourself into the right mood. Focus on the positive. “When I get these chapters read tonight, I’ll be ahead in studying for the next test, and I’ll also have plenty of time tomorrow to do X.” <em class="emphasis">Visualize</em> yourself studying well!</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use your best—and most appropriate—time of day.</strong> Different tasks require different mental skills. Some kinds of studying you may be able to start first thing in the morning as you wake, while others need your most alert moments at another time.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Break up large projects into small pieces.</strong> Whether it’s writing a paper for class, studying for a final exam, or reading a long assignment or full book, students often feel daunted at the beginning of a large project. It’s easier to get going if you break it up into stages that you schedule at separate times—and then begin with the first section that requires only an hour or two.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do the most important studying first.</strong> When two or more things require your attention, do the more crucial one first. If something happens and you can’t complete everything, you’ll suffer less if the most crucial work is done.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you have trouble getting started, do an easier task first.</strong> Like large tasks, complex or difficult ones can be daunting. If you can’t get going, switch to an easier task you can accomplish quickly. That will give you momentum, and often you feel more confident tackling the difficult task after being successful in the first one.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you’re feeling overwhelmed and stressed because you have too much to do, revisit your time planner.</strong> Sometimes it’s hard to get started if you keep thinking about other things you need to get done. Review your schedule for the next few days and make sure everything important is scheduled, then relax and concentrate on the task at hand.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you’re really floundering, talk to someone.</strong> Maybe you just don’t understand what you should be doing. Talk with your instructor or another student in the class to get back on track.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take a break.</strong> We all need breaks to help us concentrate without becoming fatigued and burned out. As a general rule, a short break every hour or so is effective in helping recharge your study energy. Get up and move around to get your blood flowing, clear your thoughts, and work off stress.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use unscheduled times to work ahead.</strong> You’ve scheduled that hundred pages of reading for later today, but you have the textbook with you as you’re waiting for the bus. Start reading now, or flip through the chapter to get a sense of what you’ll be reading later. Either way, you’ll save time later. You may be amazed how much studying you can get done during downtimes throughout the day.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your momentum.</strong> Prevent distractions, such as multitasking, that will only slow you down. Check for messages, for example, only at scheduled break times.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reward yourself.</strong> It’s not easy to sit still for hours of studying. When you successfully complete the task, you should feel good and deserve a small reward. A healthy snack, a quick video game session, or social activity can help you feel even better about your successful use of time.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Just say no.</strong> Always tell others nearby when you’re studying, to reduce the chances of being interrupted. Still, interruptions happen, and if you are in a situation where you are frequently interrupted by a family member, spouse, roommate, or friend, it helps to have your “no” prepared in advance: “No, I <em class="emphasis">really</em> have to be ready for this test” or “That’s a great idea, but let’s do it tomorrow—I <em class="emphasis">just can’t</em> today.” You shouldn’t feel bad about saying no—especially if you told that person in advance that you needed to study.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have a life.</strong> Never schedule your day or week so full of work and study that you have no time at all for yourself, your family and friends, and your larger life.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use a calendar planner and daily to-do list.</strong> We’ll look at these time management tools in the next section.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Battling Procrastination</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Procrastination is a way of thinking that lets one put off doing something that should be done now. This can happen to anyone at any time. It’s like a voice inside your head keeps coming up with these brilliant ideas for things to do right now other than studying: “I really ought to get this room cleaned up before I study” or “I can study anytime, but tonight’s the only chance I have to do X.” That voice is also very good at rationalizing: “I really don’t need to read that chapter now; I’ll have plenty of time tomorrow at lunch.…”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s03_p02">Procrastination is very powerful. Some people battle it daily, others only occasionally. Most college students procrastinate often, and about half say they need help avoiding procrastination. Procrastination can threaten one’s ability to do well on an assignment or test.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s03_p03">People procrastinate for different reasons. Some people are too relaxed in their priorities, seldom worry, and easily put off responsibilities. Others worry constantly, and that stress keeps them from focusing on the task at hand. Some procrastinate because they fear failure; others procrastinate because they fear success or are so perfectionistic that they don’t want to let themselves down. Some are dreamers. Many different factors are involved, and there are different styles of procrastinating.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s03_p04">Just as there are different causes, there are different possible solutions for procrastination. Different strategies work for different people. The time management strategies described earlier can help you avoid procrastination. Because this is a psychological issue, some additional psychological strategies can also help:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Since procrastination is usually a habit, accept that and work on breaking it as you would any other bad habit: one day at a time. Know that every time you overcome feelings of procrastination, the habit becomes weaker—and eventually you’ll have a new habit of being able to start studying right away.</li>
            <li>Schedule times for studying using a daily or weekly planner. Carry it with you and look at it often. Just being aware of the time and what you need to do today can help you get organized and stay on track.</li>
            <li>If you keep thinking of something else you might forget to do later (making you feel like you “must” do it now), write yourself a note about it for later and get it out of your mind.</li>
            <li>Counter a negative with a positive. If you’re procrastinating because you’re not looking forward to a certain task, try to think of the positive future results of doing the work.</li>
            <li>Counter a negative with a worse negative. If thinking about the positive results of completing the task doesn’t motivate you to get started, think about what could happen if you keep procrastinating. You’ll have to study tomorrow instead of doing something fun you had planned. Or you could fail the test. Some people can jolt themselves right out of procrastination.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, fear causes procrastination in some people—so don’t dwell on the thought of failing. If you’re studying for a test, and you’re so afraid of failing it that you can’t focus on studying and you start procrastinating, try to put things in perspective. Even if it’s your most difficult class and you don’t understand <em class="emphasis">everything</em> about the topic, that doesn’t mean you’ll fail, even if you may not receive an A or a B.</li>
            <li>Study with a motivated friend. Form a study group with other students who are motivated and won’t procrastinate along with you. You’ll learn good habits from them while getting the work done now.</li>
            <li>Keep a study journal. At least once a day write an entry about how you have used your time and whether you succeeded with your schedule for the day. If not, identify what factors kept you from doing your work. (Use the form at the end of this chapter.) This journal will help you see your own habits and distractions so that you can avoid things that lead to procrastination.</li>
            <li>Get help. If you really can’t stay on track with your study schedule, or if you’re always putting things off until the last minute, see a college counselor. They have lots of experience with this common student problem and can help you find ways to overcome this habit.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Calendar Planners and To-Do Lists</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p01">Calendar planners and to-do lists are effective ways to organize your time. Many types of academic planners are commercially available (check your college bookstore), or you can make your own. Some people like a page for each day, and some like a week at a time. Some use computer calendars and planners. Almost any system will work well if you use it consistently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p02">Some college students think they don’t need to actually write down their schedule and daily to-do lists. They’ve always kept it in their head before, so why write it down in a planner now? Some first-year students were talking about this one day in a study group, and one bragged that she had never had to write down her calendar because she never forgot dates. Another student reminded her how she’d forgotten a preregistration date and missed taking a course she really wanted because the class was full by the time she went online to register. “Well,” she said, “except for that time, I never forget anything!” Of course, none of us ever forgets anything—until we do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p03">Calendars and planners help you look ahead and write in important dates and deadlines so you don’t forget. But it’s just as important to use the planner to schedule <em class="emphasis">your own time,</em> not just deadlines. For example, you’ll learn later that the most effective way to study for an exam is to study in several short periods over several days. You can easily do this by choosing time slots in your weekly planner over several days that you will commit to studying for this test. You don’t need to fill every time slot, or to schedule every single thing that you do, but the more carefully and consistently you use your planner, the more successfully will you manage your time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p04">But a planner cannot contain every single thing that may occur in a day. We’d go crazy if we tried to schedule every telephone call, every e-mail, every bill to pay, every trip to the grocery store. For these items, we use a to-do list, which may be kept on a separate page in the planner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p05">Check the example of a weekly planner form in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_f01">Figure 2.5 "Weekly Planner"</a>. (You can copy this page and use it to begin your schedule planning. By using this first, you will find out whether these time slots are big enough for you or whether you’d prefer a separate planner page for each day.) Fill in this planner form for next week. First write in all your class meeting times; your work or volunteer schedule; and your usual hours for sleep, family activities, and any other activities at fixed times. Don’t forget time needed for transportation, meals, and so on. Your first goal is to find all the blocks of “free time” that are left over.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p06">Remember that this is an <strong class="emphasis bold">academic planner</strong>. Don’t try to schedule in everything in your life—this is to plan ahead to use your study time most effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p07">Next, check the syllabus for each of your courses and write important dates in the planner. If your planner has pages for the whole term, write in all exams and deadlines. Use red ink or a highlighter for these key dates. Write them in the hour slot for the class when the test occurs or when the paper is due, for example. (If you don’t yet have a planner large enough for the whole term, use <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_f01">Figure 2.5 "Weekly Planner"</a> and write any deadlines for your second week in the margin to the right. You need to know what’s coming <em class="emphasis">next</em> week to help schedule how you’re studying <em class="emphasis">this</em> week.)</p>

These are the time periods you now want to schedule in your planner. These times change from week to week, with one course requiring more time in one week because of a paper due at the end of the week and a different course requiring more the next week because of a major exam. Make sure you block out enough hours in the week to accomplish what you need to do. As you choose your study times, consider what times of day you are at your best and what times you prefer to use for social or other activities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p09">Don’t try to micromanage your schedule. Don’t try to estimate exactly how many minutes you’ll need two weeks from today to read a given chapter in a given textbook. Instead, just choose the blocks of time you will use for your studies. Don’t yet write in the exact study activity—just reserve the block. Next, look at the major deadlines for projects and exams that you wrote in earlier. Estimate how much time you may need for each and work backward on the schedule from the due date. For example,</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p10">You have a short paper due on Friday. You determine that you’ll spend ten hours total on it, from initial brainstorming and planning through to drafting and revising. Since you have other things also going on that week, you want to get an early start; you might choose to block an hour a week ahead on Saturday morning, to brainstorm your topic, and jot some preliminary notes. Monday evening is a good time to spend two hours on the next step or prewriting activities. Since you have a lot of time open Tuesday afternoon, you decide that’s the best time to reserve to write the first draft; you block out three or four hours. You make a note on the schedule to leave time open that afternoon to see your instructor during office hours in case you have any questions on the paper; if not, you’ll finish the draft or start revising. Thursday, you schedule a last block of time to revise and polish the final draft due tomorrow.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p11">If you’re surprised by this amount of planning, you may be the kind of student who used to think, “The paper’s due Friday—I have enough time Thursday afternoon, so I’ll write it then.” What’s wrong with that? First, college work is more demanding than many first-year students realize, and the instructor expects higher-quality work than you can churn out quickly without revising. Second, if you are tired on Thursday because you didn’t sleep well Wednesday night, you may be much less productive than you hoped—and without a time buffer, you’re forced to turn in a paper that is not your best work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_p13">Here are some more tips for successful schedule planning:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Studying is often most effective immediately after a class meeting. If your schedule allows, block out appropriate study time after class periods.</li>
            <li>Be realistic about time when you make your schedule. If your class runs to four o’clock and it takes you twenty minutes to wrap things up and reach your study location, don’t figure you’ll have a full hour of study between four o’clock and five o’clock.</li>
            <li>Don’t overdo it. Few people can study four or five hours nonstop, and scheduling extended time periods like that may just set you up for failure.</li>
            <li>Schedule social events that occur at set times, but just leave holes in the schedule for other activities. Enjoy those open times and recharge your energies!</li>
            <li>Try to schedule some time for exercise at least three days a week.</li>
            <li>Plan to use your time between classes wisely. If three days a week you have the same hour free between two classes, what should you do with those three hours? Maybe you need to eat, walk across campus, or run an errand. But say you have an average forty minutes free at that time on each day. Instead of just frittering the time away, use it to review your notes from the previous class or for the coming class or to read a short assignment. Over the whole term, that forty minutes three times a week adds up to a lot of study time.</li>
            <li>If a study activity is taking longer than you had scheduled, look ahead and adjust your weekly planner to prevent the stress of feeling behind.</li>
            <li>If you maintain your schedule on your computer or smartphone, it’s still a good idea to print and carry it with you. Don’t risk losing valuable study time if you’re away from the device.</li>
            <li>If you’re not paying close attention to everything in your planner, use a colored highlighter to mark the times blocked out for really important things.</li>
            <li>When following your schedule, pay attention to starting and stopping times. If you planned to start your test review at four o’clock after an hour of reading for a different class, don’t let the reading run long and take time away from studying for the test.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Your Daily To-Do List</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p01">People use to-do lists in different ways, and you should find what works best for you. As with your planner, consistent use of your to-do list will make it an effective habit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p02">Some people prefer not to carry their planner everywhere but instead copy the key information for the day onto a to-do list. Using this approach, your daily to-do list starts out with your key scheduled activities and then adds other things you hope to do today.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p03">Some people use their to-do list only for things not on their planner, such as short errands, phone calls or e-mail, and the like. This still includes important things—but they’re not scheduled out for specific times.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p04">Although we call it a daily list, the to-do list can also include things you may not get to today but don’t want to forget about. Keeping these things on the list, even if they’re a low priority, helps ensure that eventually you’ll get to it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p05">Start every day with a fresh to-do list written in a special small notebook or on a clean page in your planner. Check your planner for key activities for the day and check yesterday’s list for items remaining.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p06">Some items won’t require much time, but other activities such as assignments will. Include a time estimate for these so that later you can do them when you have enough free time. If you finish lunch and have twenty-five minutes left before your next class, what things on the list can you do now and check off?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p07">Finally, use some system to prioritize things on your list. Some students use a 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C rating system for importance. Others simply highlight or circle items that are critical to get done today. <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_f01">Figure 2.7 "Examples of Two Different Students’ To-Do Lists"</a> shows two different to-do lists—each very different but each effective for the student using it.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_p08">Here are some more tips for effectively using your daily to-do list:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>Be specific: “Read history chapter 2 (30 pages)”—not “History homework.”</li>
                <li>Put important things high on your list where you’ll see them every time you check the list.</li>
                <li>Make your list at the same time every day so that it becomes a habit.</li>
                <li>Don’t make your list overwhelming. If you added <em class="emphasis">everything</em> you eventually need to do, you could end up with so many things on the list that you’d never read through them all. If you worry you might forget something, write it in the margin of your planner’s page a week or two away.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Use</em> your list. Lists often include little things that may take only a few minutes to do, so check your list any time during the day you have a moment free.</li>
                <li>Cross out or check off things after you’ve done them—doing this becomes rewarding.</li>
                <li>Don’t use your to-do list to procrastinate. Don’t pull it out to find something else you just “have” to do instead of studying!</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management Tips for Students Who Work</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s05_p01">If you’re both working and taking classes, you seldom have large blocks of free time. Avoid temptations to stay up very late studying, for losing sleep can lead to a downward spiral in performance at both work and school. Instead, try to follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s05_l01">
            <li>If possible, adjust your work or sleep hours so that you don’t spend your most productive times at work. If your job offers flex time, arrange your schedule to be free to study at times when you perform best.</li>
            <li>Try to arrange your class and work schedules to minimize commuting time. If you are a part-time student taking two classes, taking classes back-to-back two or three days a week uses less time than spreading them out over four or five days. Working four ten-hour days rather than five eight-hour days reduces time lost to travel, getting ready for work, and so on.</li>
            <li>If you can’t arrange an effective schedule for classes and work, consider online courses that allow you to do most of the work on your own time.</li>
            <li>Use your daily and weekly planner conscientiously. Any time you have thirty minutes or more free, schedule a study activity.</li>
            <li>Consider your “body clock” when you schedule activities. Plan easier tasks for those times when you’re often fatigued and reserve alert times for more demanding tasks.</li>
            <li>Look for any “hidden” time potentials. Maybe you prefer the thirty-minute drive to work over a forty-five-minute train ride. But if you can read on the train, that’s a gain of ninety minutes every day at the cost of thirty minutes longer travel time. An hour a day can make a huge difference in your studies.</li>
            <li>Can you do quick study tasks during slow times at work? Take your class notes with you and use even five minutes of free time wisely.</li>
            <li>Remember your long-term goals. You need to work, but you also want to finish your college program. If you have the opportunity to volunteer for some overtime, consider whether it’s really worth it. Sure, the extra money would help, but could the extra time put you at risk for not doing well in your classes?</li>
            <li>Be as organized on the job as you are academically. Use your planner and to-do list for work matters, too. The better organized you are at work, the less stress you’ll feel—and the more successful you’ll be as a student also.</li>
            <li>If you have a family as well as a job, your time is even more limited. In addition to the previous tips, try some of the strategies that follow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management Tips for Students with Family</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s06_p01">Living with family members often introduces additional time stresses. You may have family obligations that require careful time management. Use all the strategies described earlier, including family time in your daily plans the same as you would hours spent at work. Don’t assume that you’ll be “free” every hour you’re home, because family events or a family member’s need for your assistance may occur at unexpected times. Schedule your important academic work well ahead and in blocks of time you control. See also the earlier suggestions for controlling your space: you may need to use the library or another space to ensure you are not interrupted or distracted during important study times.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s06_p02">Students with their own families are likely to feel time pressures. After all, you can’t just tell your partner or kids that you’ll see them in a couple years when you’re not so busy with job and college! In addition to all the planning and study strategies discussed so far, you also need to manage your family relationships and time spent with family. While there’s no magical solution for making more hours in the day, even with this added time pressure there are ways to balance your life well:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s06_l01">
            <li>Talk everything over with your family. If you’re going back to school, your family members may not have realized changes will occur. Don’t let them be shocked by sudden household changes. Keep communication lines open so that your partner and children feel they’re together with you in this new adventure. Eventually you will need their support.</li>
            <li>Work to enjoy your time together, whatever you’re doing. You may not have as much time together as previously, but cherish the time you do have—even if it’s washing dishes together or cleaning house. If you’ve been studying for two hours and need a break, spend the next ten minutes with family instead of checking e-mail or watching television. Ultimately, the important thing is <em class="emphasis">being together</em>, not going out to movies or dinners or the special things you used to do when you had more time. Look forward to being with family and appreciate every moment you are together, and they will share your attitude.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s06_l02">
            <li>Combine activities to get the most out of time. Don’t let your children watch television or play video games off by themselves while you’re cooking dinner, or you may find you have only twenty minutes family time together while eating. Instead, bring the family together in the kitchen and give everyone something to do. You can have a lot of fun together and share the day’s experiences, and you won’t feel so bad then if you have to go off and study by yourself.</li>
            <li>Share the load. Even children who are very young can help with household chores to give you more time. Attitude is everything: try to make it fun, the whole family pulling together—not something they “have” to do and may resent, just because Mom or Dad went back to school. (Remember, your kids will reach college age someday, and you want them to have a good attitude about college.) As they get older, they can do their own laundry, cook meals, and get themselves off to school, and older teens can run errands and do the grocery shopping. They will gain in the process by becoming more responsible and independent.</li>
            <li>Schedule your study time based on family activities. If you face interruptions from young children in the early evening, use that time for something simple like reviewing class notes. When you need more quiet time for concentrated reading, wait until they’ve gone to bed.</li>
            <li>Be creative with child care. Usually options are available, possibly involving extended family members, sitters, older siblings, cooperative child care with other adult students, as well as child-care centers. After a certain age, you can take your child along to campus when you attend an evening course, if there is somewhere the child can quietly read. At home, let your child have a friend over to play with. Network with other older students and learn what has worked for them. Explore all possibilities to ensure you have time to meet your college goals. And don’t feel guilty: “day care babies” grow up just as healthy psychologically as those raised in the home full time.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management Tips for Student Athletes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s07_p01">Student athletes often face unique time pressures because of the amount of time required for training, practice, and competition. During some parts of the year, athletics may involve as many hours as a full-time job. The athletic schedule can be grueling, involving weekend travel and intensive blocks of time. You can be exhausted after workouts or competitions, affecting how well you can concentrate on studies thereafter. Students on athletic scholarships often feel their sport is their most important reason for being in college, and this priority can affect their attitudes toward studying. For all of these reasons, student athletes face special time management challenges. Here are some tips for succeeding in both your sport and academics:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s07_l01">
            <li>Realize that even if your sport is more important to you, you risk everything if you don’t also succeed in your academics. Failing one class in your first year won’t get you kicked out, but you’ll have to make up that class—and you’ll end up spending more time on the subject than if you’d studied more to pass it the first time.</li>
            <li>It’s critical to plan ahead. If you have a big test or a paper due the Monday after a big weekend game, start early. Use your weekly planner to plan well in advance, making it a goal, for example, to have the paper done by Friday—instead of thinking you can magically get it done Sunday night after victory celebrations. Working ahead will also free your mind to focus better on your sport.</li>
            <li>Accept that you have two priorities—your sport and your classes—and that both come before your social life. That’s just how it is—what you have accepted in your choice to be a college athlete. If it helps, think of your classes as your job; you have to “go to study” the same as others “go to work.”</li>
            <li>Use your planner to take advantage of any downtime you have during the day between classes and at lunch. Other students may seem to have the luxury of studying during much of the afternoon when you’re at practice, and maybe they can get away with hanging out between classes, but you don’t have that time available, at least not during the season. You need to use all the time you can find to keep up with your studying.</li>
            <li>Stay on top of your courses. If you allow yourself to start slipping behind, maybe telling yourself you’ll have more time later on to catch up, just the opposite will happen. Once you get behind, you’ll lose momentum and find it more difficult to understand what’s going on the class. Eventually the stress will affect your athletic performance also.</li>
            <li>Get help when you need it. Many athletic departments offer tutoring services or referrals for extra help. But don’t wait until you’re at risk for failing a class before seeking help. A tutor won’t take your test or write your paper for you—they can only help you focus in to use your time productively in your studies. You still have to want to succeed.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch02_s03_s07_l02">
                <li>People “use” time very differently. To develop strategies for managing your time, discover your time personality and observe how much time you spend in different activities in the course of a week.</li>
                <li>Plan your schedule with two hours of study time for each hour in class. Use your most alert times of day, break up large tasks into smaller pieces and stages, take breaks to help you stay focused, avoid distractions, and reward yourself for successful accomplishments.</li>
                <li>Procrastination has many different causes for different people but is a problem for most students. Different techniques can help you battle procrastination so you can get the job done.</li>
                <li>Use a weekly calendar planner to block out study times and plan well ahead for examinations and key assignments to achieve success in school.</li>
                <li>Use a daily to-do list along with your weekly planner to avoid overlooking even smaller tasks and to make the most of your time throughout the day.</li>
                <li>Students who work, live with family, or are athletes often face significant time pressures and must make a special effort to stay organized and plan ahead for efficient studying.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch02_s04_l01">
            <li>It’s important to have short-, mid-, and long-term goals that are specific, realistic, time oriented, and attainable. Goals help you set priorities and remain motivated and committed to your college success.</li>
            <li>Attitude is the largest factor determining success in college. Work to stay positive and surround yourself with positive people, and you’ll find you are motivated to carry out the activities that will help you succeed in your courses.</li>
            <li>Planning ahead, and then following your plan, is the essence of time management. Organize both your space and your time to develop the best study habits. Learning strategies to stay on track, avoid distractions of people and technology, and to prevent procrastination will pay off not only in college but also in your career thereafter.</li>
            <li>Plan your use of time based on your “time personality” after assessing how you typically use your free time. Then use an academic weekly and daily planner to schedule blocks of time most efficiently. Start well ahead of deadlines to prevent last-minute stresses and problems completing your work.</li>
            <li>Because many college students have significant time commitments with work, family, athletics, or other activities, time management techniques are among the most important skills you can learn to help ensure your success.</li>
