        <h2 class="title editable block">Smoking and Tobacco: Why Start, and Why Is It So Hard to Stop?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p01">Everyone knows smoking is harmful to one’s health. Smoking causes cancer and lung and heart disease. Most adult smokers continue smoking not because they really think it won’t harm them but because it’s very difficult to stop.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p02">If you have never smoked or used smokeless tobacco, feel good about your choices. But read this section anyway because you may have friends now or in the future who smoke, and it’s important to understand this behavior. If you do smoke, even only rarely as a “social smoker,” be honest with yourself—wouldn’t you like to stop if you thought you could without suffering? Simply by being in college now, you’ve shown that you care about your future and your life. You likely care about your health, too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p03">Many young smokers think there is plenty of time to quit later. Social smokers, who may have a cigarette only occasionally with a friend, usually think they won’t develop a habit. But smokers are fooling themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nicotine</a><span class="glossdef">A habit-forming stimulant found in tobacco, which raises blood pressure, increases heart rate, and has toxic effects throughout the body.</span></span> is one of the most addictive drugs in our society today. Admitting this to yourself is the first step toward becoming smoke free.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p04">First, the good news. Stopping smoking brings immediate health benefits, and the benefits get better over time. Just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate drops. After two weeks to three months, your heart attack risk begins to drop and your lung function begins to improve. After one year, your added risk of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coronary heart disease</a><span class="glossdef">A heart disease caused by damage to the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.</span></span> is half that of a smoker’s. And every year your health continues to improve.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p01">Stopping isn’t easy. Many ex-smokers say it was the hardest thing they ever did. Still, over 45 million adults in the United States once smoked and then successfully stopped.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p02">You know it’s worth the effort. And it’s easier if you think it through and make a good plan. There’s lots of help available. Before you quit, the National Cancer Institute suggests you START with these five important steps:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Of all the issues that can affect a student’s health and success in college, drinking causes more problems than anything else. Everyone knows what happens when you drink too much. Your judgment is impaired and you may behave in risky ways. Your health may be affected. Your studies likely are affected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Most college students report drinking at least some alcohol at some time—and even those who do not drink are often affected by others who do. Here are a few facts about alcohol use among college students from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Death.</strong> Each year, 1,700 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related unintentional injuries, and 599,000 students are injured.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Assault.</strong> More than 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sexual abuse.</strong> More than 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Academic problems.</strong> About 25 percent of college students report academic consequences of their drinking, including missing class, falling behind, doing poorly on exams or papers, and receiving lower grades overall.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Health problems.</strong> More than 150,000 students develop an alcohol-related health problem.</li>
            <li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p03">So why is drinking so popular if it causes so many problems? You probably already know the answer to that: most college students say they have more fun when drinking. They’re not going to stop drinking just because someone lectures them about it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p04">Like everything else that affects your health and happiness—eating, exercise, use of other substances—drinking is a matter of personal choice. Like most decisions we all face, there are trade-offs. The most that anyone can reasonably ask of you is to be smart in your decisions. That means understanding the effects of alcohol and deciding to take control.</p>

Say, for example, I have a big test tomorrow, and I’ve been studying for hours, and just when I knock off to relax for a while, a friend stops by with a six-pack of beer. I’d planned to get to bed early, but my friend pops open a beer and sticks it in my hand, saying it will help me relax. So I tell myself just one, or maybe two—after all, that’s not really <em class="emphasis">drinking.</em> And let’s say I stop after two (or three) and get to bed. Maybe I don’t sleep quite as well, but I still pass the test in the morning. So—was that peer pressure or my decision?</p>

He had had a few beers at parties through high school but had never binged and felt there was nothing wrong with that as long as he kept it under control. But he was surprised how much alcohol flowed through the fraternity house, and not just at parties—and the house advisor just seemed to look the other way. He wanted to fit in, so he usually had a few whenever his roommate or others called him away from studying. One night he definitely drank too much. He slept late, missed his first two classes, and felt rotten most of the day. He told himself he’d drink only on weekends and only in moderation. Being underage didn’t bother him, but his grades hadn’t been all that great in high school, and he didn’t want to screw up his first year in college. But it was only one day before some of the older fraternity brothers interrupted his studying again and stuck a beer in his hand. He didn’t know what to do.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_p01">If you think you may be drinking too much, then you probably are. Can you stop—or drink moderately if you are of age—and still have fun with your friends? Of course. Here are some tips for enjoying yourself in social situations when others are drinking:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_l01">
                <li>Drink only moderately (if above legal age) and slowly. Your body processes alcohol at a rate of about one drink an hour—drinking faster than that leads to problems. Sip slowly. Set yourself a limit and stick to it.</li>
                <li>Drink a mixer without the alcohol. It tastes just as good or better. Alternate alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic ones to slow down the pace.</li>
                <li>Rather than just standing around with others who are drinking, stay active: move about and mingle with different people, dance, and so on.</li>
                <li>If someone tries to make you uncomfortable for not drinking, go talk to someone else.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_p02">Because drinking is a serious issue in many places, it’s a good idea to know what to do if you find yourself with a friend who has had too much to drink:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_l02">
                <li>Stay with the person if there is any risk of him hurting himself (driving, biking) or passing out. Take away his keys if necessary.</li>
                <li>If he passes out after drinking a great deal of alcohol fast and cannot be awakened, get medical help.</li>
                <li>An intoxicated person who falls asleep or passes out on his back is at risk of choking on vomit—roll him on his side or face down.</li>
                <li>Do not try to give him food or other substances in an effort to sober him up.</li>
                <li>Don’t put him in a cold shower, which could cause unconsciousness.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p01">People use drugs for the same reasons people use alcohol. They say they enjoy getting high. They may say a drug helps them relax or unwind, have fun, enjoy the company of others, or escape the pressures of being a student. While alcohol is a legal drug for those above the drinking age, most other drugs—including the use of many <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prescription drugs</a><span class="glossdef">A drug prescribed to a specific person for a specific medical condition by a health-care provider; many prescription drugs are illegal when used by someone other than the person for whom it was prescribed.</span></span> not prescribed for the person taking them—are illegal. They usually involve more serious legal consequences if the user is caught. Some people may feel there’s safety in numbers: if a lot of people are using a drug, or drinking, then how can it be too bad? But other drugs carry the same risks as alcohol for health problems, a risk of death or injury, and a serious impact on your ability to do well as a student.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p02">As with alcohol, the choice is yours. What’s important is to understand what you’re doing and make smart choices. What’s the gain, and what are the risks and costs?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p03">While society may seem to condone drinking, and the laws regarding underage drinking or being drunk in public may not seem too harsh, the legal reality of being caught with an illegal drug can impact the rest of your life. Arrest and conviction may result in being expelled from college—even with a first offense. A conviction is a permanent legal record that can keep you from getting the job you may be going to college for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Although the effects of different drugs vary widely, a single use of a drug can have serious effects and consequences. Even if you’re told that a pill is a prescription medication whose effects are mild or safe, can you really be sure of the exact ingredients and strength of that pill? Do you fully understand how it can affect you with repeated use? Can it be addictive? Could it show up on an unexpected random drug test at work?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p05"><a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_t01">Table 10.1 "Common Prescription and Illegal Drugs on Campuses"</a> lists some of the possible effects of drugs used by college students. Good decisions also involve being honest with oneself. Why do I use (or am thinking about using) this drug? Am I trying to escape some aspect of my life (stress, a bad job, a boring class)? Could the effects of using this drug be worse than what I’m trying to escape?</p>

                    <li>Excessive drinking or substance abuse is a common—but unhealthy—response to the stresses of college life. While the decisions are yours, it’s important to understand the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs and how they impact your life.</li>
                    <li>Quitting smoking is hard, but it’s clearly worth it—and lots of help is available. If you’re a smoker, make this the year you become proud of yourself for quitting.</li>
                    <li>If you like to drink, be honest with yourself. How much does drinking enrich your life, and how much do the effects of drinking interfere with your life? Make smart decisions so that you live your life to its fullest without regrets about losing control.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding drugs can be a complicated issue, certainly not as simple as simply deciding to say no. But you’ve already made the decision to attend college, and that’s a smart decision. Make smart choices in other areas of your life as well.</li>
