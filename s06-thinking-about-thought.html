        <h2 class="title editable block">It’s All in Your Head</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s00_p01">Throughout this book, we make the case that college is really quite different from high school. Sure, the social life is different, and there are different pressures in college, perhaps a family to support or a job schedule to coordinate with studies. But the two most fundamental differences involve expectations—the expectation that you will be independent and take responsibility for your actions and the expectation that you will think for yourself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s00_p02">Remember the heavy “thinking” you did in high school? Most of it was recalling facts or information you had previously committed to memory. Perhaps in some courses you were asked to support a statement or hypothesis using content from your textbook or class. Your thinking in high school was very structured and tied closely to reflecting what was taught in class.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s00_p03">In college, you are expected to think for yourself; to access and evaluate new approaches and ideas; to contribute to your knowledge base; and to develop or create new, fresh ideas. You will be required to develop and use a variety of thinking skills—higher-order thinking skills—which you seldom used in high school. In college, your instructors’ roles will be not only to supply a base of new information and ideas, as good instructors will challenge you to stretch your skills and knowledge base through critical and creative thinking. Much of their teaching involves the questions they ask, not the directions they give. Your success in college education—and in life beyond college—is directly linked to becoming a better and more complete thinker. Becoming a better and more complete thinker requires mastering some skills and consistent practice.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s01_p01">So what are the various types of thinking skills, and what kind things are we doing when we apply them? In the 1950s, Benjamin Bloom developed a classification of thinking skills that is still helpful today; it is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bloom’s taxonomy</a><span class="glossdef">A classification of thinking skills developed by Benjamin Bloom. In order of increasing complexity, they are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.</span></span>. He lists six types of thinking skills, ranked in order of complexity: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "Types of Thinking Skills"</a> outlines each skill and what is involved in that type of thinking, as updated by Lorin Anderson and David Krothwohl.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lochhaas-fn03_001">L.

You’ve likely had a great deal of experience with the lower-level thinking skills (yellow section). The midlevel skills are skills you will get a lot of practice with in college, and you may be well on your way to mastering them already. The higher-level thinking skills (red section) are the most demanding, and you will need to invest focused effort to develop them.</p>

The list above indicates how much information we can easily access. In fact, the abundance of information might be the greater challenge. Your success will depend on what you can do with the information, not just on what you know. How we filter and use that abundance of data is the reason critical thinking has become so important today.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Critical thinking</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to discover the value of an idea, a set of beliefs, a claim, or an argument. It requires you to use logic and reasoning to evaluate evidence or information to make a decision or reach a conclusion.</span></span> is the ability to discover the value of an idea, a set of beliefs, a claim, or an argument.

        <li>a way to uncover bias and prejudices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_p03">Critical thinking is a part of everyday life, too. Decisions you make can have a lasting impact on your life, and these decisions benefit from critical thinking. Did you ever decide to quit smoking or to lose weight? Were you successful? How did you decide to attend the college you are in? Was that the right choice for you? In any of these cases, could you have made a better decision if you had better or more information?</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Critical Thinking Process</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p01">The critical thinking process is really nothing more than asking the right questions to understand a problem or issue and then gathering the data you need to complete the decision or take sides on an issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">What is the problem or issue I am considering really about?</strong> Understanding this is key to successful critical thinking. What is the objective? A position? A decision? Are you deciding what candidate in an election will do a better overall job, or are you looking to strengthen the political support for a particular cause? Are you really against a recommendation from your dad, or are you using the issue to establish your independence?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p03">Do you understand the terms related to the issue? Are you in agreement with the proponent’s definitions? For example, if you are evaluating a quotation on the health-care system for use in a paper, your objective might be to decide to use the quotation or not, but before you can make that decision you need to understand what the writer is really saying. If a term like “family” is used, for example, does it mean direct relations or extended family?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">What are my options?</strong> What are choices that are available to you (if you are making a decision), or what are the “sides” (in the case of a position) you might choose to agree with? What are their differences? What are the likely consequences of each option? In making a decision, it might be helpful to ask yourself, “What is the worst thing that might happen in each scenario?” Examining different points of view is very important; there may be dozens of alternative viewpoints to a particular issue—and the validity of each can change depending on circumstances. A position that is popular or politically correct today may not have been a year ago, and there is no guarantee it will be right in the future. Likewise, a solution to a personal problem that was successful for your roommate may not apply to you. Remember also that sometimes the best option might be a combination of the options you identify initially.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">What do I know about each option?</strong> First, make sure you have all the information about each option. Do you have all the information to support each of your likely options? What is still missing? Where can you get the information you need? Keep an open mind and don’t dismiss supporting information on any position before you evaluate it carefully.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">How good is my information?</strong> Now it’s time to evaluate the quality of the support of each option or point of view. Evaluate the strengths and the weaknesses of each piece of supporting evidence. Are all the relevant facts presented? Are some facts presented in misleading ways? Are enough examples presented to support the premise? Consider the source of the supporting information. Who is the expert presenting the facts? That “expert” may have a vested interest in the position. Consider that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bias</a><span class="glossdef">A personal inclination that may prevent unprejudiced consideration of a question.</span></span>, more for understanding the point of view than for rejecting it. Consider your own opinions (especially when working with emotional issues); are your emotional ties to a point of view getting in your way of clear thinking (your own biases)? If you really like a particular car model, are you giving the financial implications of buying that car a fair consideration? Are there any errors or fallacies in your logic?

                </li>
                <li>Look for evidence that contradicts your point of view. Pretend to disagree with the position you are supporting. What parts of your argument are weak? Do you have the supporting facts to overcome that evidence?</li>

                    <p class="para">Create a set of criteria you will use to evaluate the strength of information you want to use to support your argument. Ask questions like these:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_l04">
                        <li>What is the source of this information?</li>
                        <li>Is the author well respected in the field?</li>
                        <li>When was this information developed? Is that important? Why?</li>
                        <li>Does the author or publisher have an agenda for publishing the information? How does that agenda affect the credibility of the information?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a table on which you list your main points, then for each one, list the evidence you have to support it. This method will help you visually identify where you have weak evidence and what points actually lack evidence.</li>
                <li>Be willing to admit that you lack information to support a point of view or make a decision. Ask questions or do some focused research to get what you still need.</li>
                <li>Make sure that your assumptions and points of view are supported by facts, not opinions.</li>
                <li>Learn what types of fallacies you use habitually, and then be on the lookout for them. Writers will often rely on certain types of arguments as a matter of habit. Review some of your old papers to identify which fallacies you need to avoid.</li>
                <li>Question your characterizations of others. Are those authorities truly competent in the area you are considering? Are you attacking the opponents of your point of view rather than attacking their arguments?</li>
                <li>Be careful of broad generalizations. Claims that use absolute words like “all,” “none,” “always,” “never,” “no one,” and “everyone” require much more proof than claims that use words like “most,” “some,” “often,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” and so on.</li>

            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_p09">One of the most consistent uses for critical thinking in your college work is in considering the value of research material and deciding how to use it. The Internet gives you access to an almost unlimited amount of data, and you must choose what to use carefully. Following are some guidelines.</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch03_s02_s01_l05">
                <li>Look at the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">URL</a><span class="glossdef">An Internet address; URL stands for “uniform resource locator.”</span></span>, the Web address. It can give you important information about the reliability and intentions of the site. Start with the page publisher. Have you heard of this source before? If so, would you consider it a reliable source for the kind of material you are about to read? Now consider the domain type in the URL, which follows the period after the publisher: “.com” and “.biz” are used by commercial enterprises, “.org” is normally used by nonprofit organizations, and “.edu” is reserved for educational institutions. None of these is necessarily bad or good, but they may give you a sense behind the motivation for publishing this material. Are you dealing with a company or the Web site of an individual—and how might that affect the quality of the information on that site?</li>
                <li>What can you learn from poking around with navigation tabs or buttons, and what do they tell you about the objective of the Web site? Look for a tab labeled “About Us” or “Biography.”</li>
                <li>Consider what others are saying about the site. Does the author offer references, reviews, or quotations about the material? What do they say? Check the blogosphere to see what other people think of the author or Web site.</li>
                <li>Trust your own impressions about the material. Is the information consistent with what you already know?</li>
                <li>Ask yourself why the Web site was written. (To inform? To provide data or facts? To sell something? To promote a cause? To parody?)</li>
            </ol>

It is a deliberate process that allows you to think in ways that improve the likelihood of generating new ideas or thoughts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_p04">Let’s start by killing a couple of myths:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creativity is an inherited skill.</strong> Creativity is not something people are born with but is a skill that is developed over time with consistent practice. It can be argued that people you think were “born” creative because their parents were creative, too, are creative simply because they have been practicing creative thinking since childhood, stimulated by their parents’ questions and discussions.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creativity is free-form thinking.</strong> While you may want to free yourself from all preconceived notions, there is a recognizable structure to creative thinking. Rules and requirements do not limit creative thinking—they provide the scaffolding on which truly creative solutions can be built. Free-form thinking often lacks direction or an objective; creative thinking is aimed at producing a defined outcome or solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_p05">Creative thinking involves coming up with new or original ideas; it is the process of seeing the same things others see but seeing them differently. You use skills such as examining associations and relationships, flexibility, elaboration, modification, imagery, and metaphorical thinking. In the process, you will stimulate your curiosity, come up with new approaches to things, and have fun!</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Creative Thinking</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feed your curiosity.</strong> Read. Read books, newspapers, magazines, blogs—anything at any time. When surfing the Web, follow links just to see where they will take you. Go to the theatre or movies. Attend lectures. Creative people make a habit of gathering information, because they never know when they might put it to good use. Creativity is often as much about rearranging known ideas as it is about creating a completely new concept. The more “known ideas” you have been exposed to, the more options you’ll have for combining them into new concepts.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Develop your flexibility</strong> by looking for a second right answer. Throughout school we have been conditioned to come up with the right answer; the reality is that there is often more than one “right” answer. Examine all the possibilities. Look at the items in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.4</a>. Which is different from all the others?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 3.4</span> </p>
            <img src="section_06/522409623311cfcf45d1e8a2bc137455.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_p01">If you chose C, you’re right; you can’t eat a board. Maybe you chose D; that’s right, too—clams are the only animal on the chart. B is right, as it’s the only item you can make oil from, and A can also be right; it’s the only red item.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Each option can be right depending on your point of view. Life is full of multiple answers, and if we go along with only the first most obvious answer, we are in danger of losing the context for our ideas. The value of an idea can only be determined by comparing it with another. Multiple ideas will also help you generate new approaches by combining elements from a variety of “right” answers. In fact, the greatest danger to creative thinking is to have only one idea. Always ask yourself, “What’s the <em class="emphasis">other</em> right answer?”</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_l05">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Combine old ideas in new ways.</strong> When King C. Gillette registered his patent for the safety razor, he built on the idea of disposable bottle caps, but his venture didn’t become profitable until he toyed with a watch spring and came up with the idea of how to manufacture inexpensive (therefore disposable) blades. Bottle caps and watch springs are far from men’s grooming materials, but Gillette’s genius was in combining those existing but unlikely ideas. Train yourself to think “out of the box.” Ask yourself questions like, “What is the most ridiculous solution I can come up with for this problem?” or “If I were transported by a time machine back to the 1930s, how would I solve this problem?” You may enjoy watching competitive design, cooking, or fashion shows (<em class="emphasis">Top Chef</em>, <em class="emphasis">Chopped</em>, <em class="emphasis">Project Runway</em>, etc.); they are great examples of combining old ideas to make new, functional ones.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Think metaphorically.</strong> Metaphors are useful to describe complex ideas; they are also useful in making problems more familiar and in stimulating possible solutions. For example, if you were a partner in a company about to take on outside investors, you might use the pie metaphor to clarify your options (a smaller slice of a bigger pie versus a larger slice of a smaller pie). If an organization you are a part of is lacking direction, you may search for a “steady hand at the tiller,” communicating quickly that you want a consistent, nonreactionary, calm leader. Based on that ship-steering metaphor, it will be easier to see which of your potential leaders you might want to support. Your ability to work comfortably with metaphors takes practice. When faced with a problem, take time to think about metaphors to describe it, and the desired solution. Observe how metaphors are used throughout communication and think about why those metaphors are effective. Have you ever noticed that the financial business uses water-based metaphors (cash <em class="emphasis">flow</em>, <em class="emphasis">frozen</em> assets, <em class="emphasis">liquidity</em>) and that meteorologists use war terms (<em class="emphasis">fronts</em>, wind <em class="emphasis">force</em>, storm <em class="emphasis">surge</em>)? What kinds of metaphors are used in your area of study?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask.</strong> A creative thinker always questions the way things are: Why are we doing things this way? What were the objectives of this process and the assumptions made when we developed the process? Are they still valid? What if we changed certain aspects? What if our circumstances changed? Would we need to change the process? How? Get in the habit of asking questions—lots of questions.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_p01">Much of your college and professional life will be spent solving problems; some will be complex, such as deciding on a career, and require time and effort to come up with a solution. Others will be small, such as deciding what to eat for lunch, and will allow you to make a quick decision based entirely on your own experience. But, in either case, when coming up with the solution and deciding what to do, follow the same basic steps.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Define the problem.</strong> Use your analytical skills. What is the real issue? Why is it a problem? What are the root causes? What kinds of outcomes or actions do you expect to generate to solve the problem? What are some of the key characteristics that will make a good choice: Timing? Resources? Availability of tools and materials? For more complex problems, it helps to actually write out the problem and the answers to these questions. Can you clarify your understanding of the problem by using metaphors to illustrate the issue?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Narrow the problem.</strong> Many problems are made up of a series of smaller problems, each requiring its own solution. Can you break the problem into different facets? What aspects of the current issue are “noise” that should not be considered in the problem solution? (Use critical thinking to separate facts from opinion in this step.)</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Generate possible solutions.</strong> List all your options. Use your creative thinking skills in this phase. Did you come up with the second “right” answer, and the third or the fourth? Can any of these answers be combined into a stronger solution? What past or existing solutions can be adapted or combined to solve this problem?</li>

        <h3 class="title">Group Think: Effective Brainstorming</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Brainstorming</a><span class="glossdef">A process of generating ideas for solutions in a group of people.</span></span> is a process of generating ideas for solutions in a group. This method is very effective because ideas from one person will trigger additional ideas from another. The following guidelines make for an effective brainstorming session:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l03">
            <li>Decide who should moderate the session. That person may participate, but his main role is to keep the discussion flowing.</li>
            <li>Define the problem to be discussed and the time you will allow to consider it.</li>
            <li>Write all ideas down on a board or flip chart for all participants to see.</li>
            <li>Encourage everyone to speak.</li>
            <li>Do not allow criticism of ideas. <em class="emphasis">All</em> ideas are good during a brainstorm. Suspend disbelief until after the session. Remember a wildly impossible idea may trigger a creative and feasible solution to a problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l04">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose the best solution.</strong> Use your critical thinking skills to select the most likely choices. List the pros and cons for each of your selections. How do these lists compare with the requirements you identified when you defined the problem? If you still can’t decide between options, you may want to seek further input from your brainstorming team.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Decisions, Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p01">You will be called on to make many decisions in your life. Some will be personal, like what to major in, or whether or not to get married. Other times you will be making decisions on behalf of others at work or for a volunteer organization. Occasionally you will be asked for your opinion or experience for decisions others are making. To be effective in all of these circumstances, it is helpful to understand some principles about decision making.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p02">First, define who is responsible for solving the problem or making the decision. In an organization, this may be someone above or below you on the organization chart but is usually the person who will be responsible for implementing the solution. Deciding on an academic major should be your decision, because <em class="emphasis">you</em> will have to follow the course of study. Deciding on the boundaries of a sales territory would most likely be the sales manager who supervises the territories, because he or she will be responsible for producing the results with the combined territories. Once you define who is responsible for making the decision, everyone else will fall into one of two roles: giving input, or in rare cases, approving the decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p03">Understanding the role of input is very important for good decisions. Input is sought or given due to experience or expertise, but it is up to the decision maker to weigh the input and decide whether and how to use it. Input should be fact based, or if offering an opinion, it should be clearly stated as such. Finally, once input is given, the person giving the input must support the other’s decision, whether or not the input is actually used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Consider a team working on a project for a science course. The team assigns you the responsibility of analyzing and presenting a large set of complex data. Others on the team will set up the experiment to demonstrate the hypothesis, prepare the class presentation, and write the paper summarizing the results. As you face the data, you go to the team to seek input about the level of detail on the data you should consider for your analysis. The person doing the experiment setup thinks you should be very detailed, because then it will be easy to compare experiment results with the data. However, the person preparing the class presentation wants only high-level data to be considered because that will make for a clearer presentation. If there is not a clear understanding of the decision-making process, each of you may think the decision is yours to make because it influences the output of your work; there will be conflict and frustration on the team. If the decision maker is clearly defined upfront, however, and the input is thoughtfully given and considered, a good decision can be made (perhaps a creative compromise?) and the team can get behind the decision and work together to complete the project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p05">Finally, there is the approval role in decisions. This is very common in business decisions but often occurs in college work as well (the professor needs to approve the theme of the team project, for example). Approval decisions are usually based on availability of resources, legality, history, or policy.</p>

            <li>Your ability to think critically and creatively is a key to your success in college and in life. You should develop and practice these skills.</li>
            <li>Bloom’s taxonomy provides a framework to describe the many kinds of thinking we need to do. Up to this point, you probably have practiced most of the lower-level thinking skills but have not had much experience with the higher-level skills (critical thinking and creative thinking).</li>
            <li>Critical thinking involves evaluating the strength of ideas or concepts by asking questions about them. Critical thinking will also allow you to identify and weed out logical fallacies that weaken the value of an idea.</li>
            <li>Creative thinking is the process of generating new ideas, concepts, or solutions. This often involves adapting existing ideas or combining them in new ways to create a new solution.</li>
            <li>Problem solving is effectively achieved by applying both critical thinking and creative thinking to generate viable solutions and decisions.</li>
