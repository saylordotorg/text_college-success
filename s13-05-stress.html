The thing that causes stress, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stressor</a><span class="glossdef">Anything, such as an event or situation, that causes a person stress.</span></span>, captures our attention and causes a physical and emotional reaction. Stressors include physical threats, such as a car we suddenly see coming at us too fast, and the stress reaction likely includes jumping out of the way—with our heart beating fast and other physical changes. Most of our stressors are not physical threats but situations or events like an upcoming test or an emotional break-up. Stressors also include long-lasting emotional and mental concerns such as worries about money or finding a job. Take the Stress Self-Assessment.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Causes Stress?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p01">Not all stressors are bad things. Exciting, positive things also cause a type of stress, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eustress</a><span class="glossdef">A positive and stimulating kind or level of stress.</span></span>. Falling in love, getting an unexpected sum of money, acing an exam you’d worried about—all of these are positive things that affect the body and mind in ways similar to negative stress: you can’t help thinking about it, you may lose your appetite and lie awake at night, and your routine life may be momentarily disrupted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p02">But the kind of stress that causes most trouble results from negative stressors. Life events that usually cause significant stress include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Serious illness or injury</li>
            <li>Serious illness, injury, or death of a family member or loved one</li>
            <li>Losing a job or sudden financial catastrophe</li>
            <li>Unwanted pregnancy</li>
            <li>Divorce or ending a long-term relationship (including parents’ divorce)</li>
            <li>Being arrested or convicted of a crime</li>
            <li>Being put on academic probation or suspended</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p03">Life events like these usually cause a lot of stress that may begin suddenly and disrupt one’s life in many ways. Fortunately, these stressors do not occur every day and eventually end—though they can be very severe and disruptive when experienced. Some major life stresses, such as having a parent or family member with a serious illness, can last a long time and may require professional help to cope with them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p04">Everyday kinds of stressors are far more common but can add up and produce as much stress as a major life event:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_l02">
            <li>Anxiety about not having enough time for classes, job, studies, and social life</li>
            <li>Worries about grades, an upcoming test, or an assignment</li>
            <li>Money concerns</li>
            <li>Conflict with a roommate, someone at work, or family member</li>
            <li>Anxiety or doubts about one’s future or difficulty choosing a major or career</li>
            <li>Frequent colds, allergy attacks, other continuing health issues</li>
            <li>Concerns about one’s appearance, weight, eating habits, and so on.</li>
            <li>Relationship tensions, poor social life, loneliness</li>
            <li>Time-consuming hassles such as a broken-down car or the need to find a new apartment</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p05">Take a moment and reflect on the list above. How many of these stressors have you experienced in the last month? The last year? Circle all the ones that you have experienced. Now go back to your Stress Self-Assessment and look at what you wrote there for causes of your stress. Write any additional things that cause you stress on the blank lines above.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p06">How many stressors have you circled and written in? There is no magic number of stressors that an “average” or “normal” college student experiences—because everyone is unique. In addition, stressors come and go: the stress caused by a midterm exam tomorrow morning may be gone by noon, replaced by feeling good about how you did. Still, most college students are likely to circle about half the items on this list.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p07">But it’s not the <em class="emphasis">number</em> of stressors that counts. You might have circled only one item on that list—but it could produce so much stress for you that you’re just as stressed out as someone else who circled all of them. The point of this exercise is to start by understanding what causes your own stress as a base for learning what to do about it.</p>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What’s Wrong with Stress?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p01">Physically, stress prepares us for action: the classic “fight-or-flight” reaction when confronted with a danger. Our heart is pumping fast, and we’re breathing faster to supply the muscles with energy to fight or flee. Many physical effects in the body prepare us for whatever actions we may need to take to survive a threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p02">But what about nonphysical stressors, like worrying about grades? Are there any positive effects there? Imagine what life would feel like if you never had worries, never felt any stress at all. If you never worried about grades or doing well on a test, how much studying would you do for it? If you never thought at all about money, would you make any effort to save it or make it? Obviously, stress can be a good thing when it motivates us to do something, whether it’s study, work, resolving a conflict with another, and so on. So it’s not stress itself that’s negative—it’s <em class="emphasis">unresolved or persistent stress</em> that starts to have unhealthy effects. Chronic (long-term) stress is associated with many physical changes and illnesses, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>Weakened <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">immune system</a><span class="glossdef">The body system, involving many different organs and body tissues, responsible for defending the body against infection and disease.</span></span>, making you more likely to catch a cold and to suffer from any illness longer</li>
            <li>More frequent digestive system problems, including constipation or diarrhea, ulcers, and indigestion</li>
            <li>Elevated <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blood pressure</a><span class="glossdef">The pressure blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels, resulting from complex processes in the body; high blood pressure is associated with several diseases and health problems.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Increased risk of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diabetes</a><span class="glossdef">A disease in which the body has high levels of sugar in the blood because of an inability to manage blood glucose; diabetes is associated with a range of serious health problems.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Muscle and back pain</li>
            <li>More frequent headaches, fatigue, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insomnia</a><span class="glossdef">An inability to sleep; chronic sleeplessness.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Greater risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular problems over the long term</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p03">Chronic or acute (intense short-term) stress also affects our minds and emotions in many ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_l02">
            <li>Difficulty thinking clearly or concentrating</li>
            <li>Poor memory</li>
            <li>More frequent negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, frustration, powerlessness, resentment, or nervousness—and a general negative outlook on life</li>
            <li>Greater difficulty dealing with others because of irritability, anger, or avoidance</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p04">No wonder we view stress as such a negative thing! As much as we’d like to eliminate all stressors,however, it just can’t happen. Too many things in the real world cause stress and always will.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Unhealthy Responses to Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p01">Since many stressors are unavoidable, the question is what to do about the resulting stress.

            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p07"><em class="emphasis">Interpretation</em>: If the subtraction of the score for questions 11 to 15 from the first score is a positive number, then your past coping methods for dealing with stress have not been as healthy and productive as they could be. Items 1 to 10 are generally not effective ways of dealing with stress, while items 11 to 15 usually are. If you final score is over 20, you’re probably like most beginning college students—feeling a lot of stress and not yet sure how best to deal with it.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p08">What’s wrong with those stress-reduction behaviors listed first? Why not watch television or get a lot of sleep when you’re feeling stressed, if that makes you feel better? While it may feel better temporarily to escape feelings of stress in those ways, ultimately they may cause more stress themselves. If you’re worried about grades and being too busy to study as much as you need to, then letting an hour or two slip by watching television will make you even more worried later because then you have even less time. Eating too much may make you sluggish and less able to focus, and if you’re trying to lose weight, you’ll now feel just that much more stressed by what you’ve done. Alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and drugs all generally increase one’s stress over time. Complaining to friends? Over time, your friends will tire of hearing it or tire of arguing with you because a complaining person isn’t much fun to be around. So eventually you may find yourself even more alone and stressed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p09">Yet there is a bright side: there are lots of very positive ways to cope with stress that will also improve your health, make it easier to concentrate on your studies, and make you a happier person overall.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Coping with Stress</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p01">Look back at your list of stressors that you circled earlier. For each, consider whether it is external (like bad job hours or not having enough money) or internal, originating in your attitudes and thoughts. Mark each item with an E (external) or an I (internal).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p02">You may be able to eliminate many external stressors. Talk to your boss about changing your work hours. If you have money problems, work on a budget you can live with (see <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a>), look for a new job, or reduce your expenses by finding a cheaper apartment, selling your car, and using public transportation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p03">What about other external stressors? Taking so many classes that you don’t have the time to study for all of them? Keep working on your time management skills (<a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>). Schedule your days carefully and stick to the schedule. Take fewer classes next term if necessary. What else can you do to eliminate external stressors? Change apartments, get a new roommate, find better child care—consider all your options. And don’t hesitate to talk things over with a college counselor, who may offer other solutions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p04">Internal stressors, however, are often not easily resolved. We can’t make all stressors go away, but we can learn how to cope so that we don’t feel so stressed out most of the time. We can take control of our lives. We can find healthy coping strategies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p05">All the topics in this chapter involve stress one way or another. Many of the healthy habits that contribute to our wellness and happiness also reduce stress and minimize its effects.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Get Some Exercise</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s01_p01">Exercise, especially <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aerobic exercise</a><span class="glossdef">Brisk physical activity that requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body’s increased oxygen needs.</span></span>, is a great way to help reduce stress. Exercise increases the production of certain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hormones</a><span class="glossdef">A substance produced in the body that has physical, mental, or emotional effects.</span></span>, which leads to a better mood and helps counter depression and anxiety. Exercise helps you feel more energetic and focused so that you are more productive in your work and studies and thus less likely to feel stressed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p01">You know the saying about the optimist who sees the glass as half full and the pessimist who sees the same glass as half empty. Guess which one feels more stress?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p02">Much of the stress you feel may be rooted in your attitudes toward school, your work—your whole life. If you don’t feel good about these things, how do you change? To begin with, you really need to think about yourself. What makes you happy? Are you expecting your college career to be perfect and always exciting, with never a dull class or reading assignment? Or can you be happy that you are in fact succeeding in college and foresee a great life and career ahead?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p03">Maybe you just need to take a fun elective course to balance that “serious” course that you’re not enjoying so much. Maybe you just need to play an intramural sport to feel as good as you did playing in high school. Maybe you just need to take a brisk walk every morning to feel more alert and stimulated. Maybe listening to some great music on the way to work will brighten your day. Maybe calling up a friend to study together for that big test will make studying more fun.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p04">No one answer works for everyone—you have to look at your life, be honest with yourself about what affects your daily attitude, and then look for ways to make changes. The good news is that although old negative habits can be hard to break, once you’ve turned positive changes into new habits, they will last into a brighter future.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Deep breathing.</strong> Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely.
