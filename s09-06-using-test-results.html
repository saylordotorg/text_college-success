            <li>Effectively evaluate your test results and correct your mistakes.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p01">So far, we have focused on how to study for and take tests effectively. This section discusses how to <em class="emphasis">use</em> test results to their greatest benefit. Some of your most important learning begins when your graded test paper is returned to you. Your first reaction, of course, is to see what grade you received and how you did compared with your classmates. This is a natural reaction.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p02">Make sure you listen to the instructor as the papers are returned. What is the instructor saying about the test? Is there a particular point everyone had trouble with? Does the instructor generally think everyone did well? The instructor’s comments at this point may give you important information about what you should study more, about the value of review sessions, and even about possible questions for the next exam.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_p03">Although you may be tempted to throw away the exam, don’t. It is a very helpful tool for the next phase of preparing for learning. This is a three-step process, beginning with evaluating your results.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluating Your Test Results</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_p01">When you receive your test back, sit quietly and take a close look at it. What questions did you get wrong? What kind of mistakes were they? (See <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_t01">Table 6.2 "Exam Errors and How to Correct Them"</a>.) Do you see a pattern? What questions did you get right? What were your strengths? What can you learn from the instructor’s comments?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_p02">Now think of the way in which you prepared for the exam and the extent to which you applied the exam strategies described earlier in this chapter. Were you prepared for the exam? Did you study the right material? What surprised you? Did you read the entire test before starting? Did your time allocation work well, or were you short of time on certain parts of the exam?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s01_p03">Based on your analysis of your test, identify the kind of corrective steps you should take to improve your learning and test performance. Implement those steps as you begin your preparation for your next class.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s02_p01">The second step in making your test work for you is to correct your wrong answers. The last time you wrote the information (when you took the test), you created a link to wrong information in your memory, so that must be corrected.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s02_l01">
            <li>For multiple-choice questions, write out the question stem with the correct answer to form a single correct sentence or phrase.</li>
            <li>For true-or-false questions, write the full statement if it is true; if it is false, reword it in such a way that it is true (such as by inserting the word “not”). Then write the new statement.</li>
            <li>For math and science questions involving calculations, redo the entire solution with the calculations written out fully.</li>
            <li>You need not rewrite an entire essay question if you did not do well, but you should create a new outline for what would be a correct answer. Make sure you incorporate any ideas triggered by your instructor’s comments.</li>
            <li>When you have rewritten all your answers, read them all out loud before incorporating your new answers in your notes.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Integrating Your Test into Your Study Guide</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s03_p01">Your corrected quizzes and midterm exams are an important study tool for final exams. Make sure you file them with your notes for the study unit. Take the time to annotate your notes based on the exam. Pay particular attention to any gaps in your notes on topics that appeared in the quiz or exam. Research those points in your text or online and complete your notes. Review your exams throughout the term (not just before the final) to be sure you cement the course material into your memory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s06_s03_p02">When you prepare for the final exam, start by reviewing your quizzes and other tests to predict the kinds of questions the instructor may ask on the final. This will help focus your final studying when you have a large amount of coursework to cover.</p>

Take notes on what you had trouble with and the expected answers. Add these notes into your study guide. Make sure you don’t lose out on the opportunity to learn from your results.</p>
