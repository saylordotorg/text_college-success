    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_p02">Let’s face it: many jobs are subject to outsourcing. The more menial or mechanical the job, the greater the likelihood that there will be someone overseas ready to do the job for a lot less pay. But generating new ideas, fostering innovation, and developing processes or plans to implement them are something that cannot be easily farmed out, and these are strengths of the American collegiate education. Businesses want problem solvers, not just doers. Developing your creative thinking skills will position you for lifelong success in whatever career you choose.</p>

It is a deliberate process that allows you to think in ways that improve the likelihood of generating new ideas or thoughts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_p04">Let’s start by killing a couple of myths:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creativity is an inherited skill.</strong> Creativity is not something people are born with but is a skill that is developed over time with consistent practice. It can be argued that people you think were “born” creative because their parents were creative, too, are creative simply because they have been practicing creative thinking since childhood, stimulated by their parents’ questions and discussions.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creativity is free-form thinking.</strong> While you may want to free yourself from all preconceived notions, there is a recognizable structure to creative thinking. Rules and requirements do not limit creative thinking—they provide the scaffolding on which truly creative solutions can be built. Free-form thinking often lacks direction or an objective; creative thinking is aimed at producing a defined outcome or solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_p05">Creative thinking involves coming up with new or original ideas; it is the process of seeing the same things others see but seeing them differently. You use skills such as examining associations and relationships, flexibility, elaboration, modification, imagery, and metaphorical thinking. In the process, you will stimulate your curiosity, come up with new approaches to things, and have fun!</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Creative Thinking</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feed your curiosity.</strong> Read. Read books, newspapers, magazines, blogs—anything at any time. When surfing the Web, follow links just to see where they will take you. Go to the theatre or movies. Attend lectures. Creative people make a habit of gathering information, because they never know when they might put it to good use. Creativity is often as much about rearranging known ideas as it is about creating a completely new concept. The more “known ideas” you have been exposed to, the more options you’ll have for combining them into new concepts.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Develop your flexibility</strong> by looking for a second right answer. Throughout school we have been conditioned to come up with the right answer; the reality is that there is often more than one “right” answer. Examine all the possibilities. Look at the items in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.4</a>. Which is different from all the others?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 3.4</span> </p>
            <img src="section_06/522409623311cfcf45d1e8a2bc137455.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_p01">If you chose C, you’re right; you can’t eat a board. Maybe you chose D; that’s right, too—clams are the only animal on the chart. B is right, as it’s the only item you can make oil from, and A can also be right; it’s the only red item.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Each option can be right depending on your point of view. Life is full of multiple answers, and if we go along with only the first most obvious answer, we are in danger of losing the context for our ideas. The value of an idea can only be determined by comparing it with another. Multiple ideas will also help you generate new approaches by combining elements from a variety of “right” answers. In fact, the greatest danger to creative thinking is to have only one idea. Always ask yourself, “What’s the <em class="emphasis">other</em> right answer?”</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s03_s01_l05">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Combine old ideas in new ways.</strong> When King C. Gillette registered his patent for the safety razor, he built on the idea of disposable bottle caps, but his venture didn’t become profitable until he toyed with a watch spring and came up with the idea of how to manufacture inexpensive (therefore disposable) blades. Bottle caps and watch springs are far from men’s grooming materials, but Gillette’s genius was in combining those existing but unlikely ideas. Train yourself to think “out of the box.” Ask yourself questions like, “What is the most ridiculous solution I can come up with for this problem?” or “If I were transported by a time machine back to the 1930s, how would I solve this problem?” You may enjoy watching competitive design, cooking, or fashion shows (<em class="emphasis">Top Chef</em>, <em class="emphasis">Chopped</em>, <em class="emphasis">Project Runway</em>, etc.); they are great examples of combining old ideas to make new, functional ones.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Think metaphorically.</strong> Metaphors are useful to describe complex ideas; they are also useful in making problems more familiar and in stimulating possible solutions. For example, if you were a partner in a company about to take on outside investors, you might use the pie metaphor to clarify your options (a smaller slice of a bigger pie versus a larger slice of a smaller pie). If an organization you are a part of is lacking direction, you may search for a “steady hand at the tiller,” communicating quickly that you want a consistent, nonreactionary, calm leader. Based on that ship-steering metaphor, it will be easier to see which of your potential leaders you might want to support. Your ability to work comfortably with metaphors takes practice. When faced with a problem, take time to think about metaphors to describe it, and the desired solution. Observe how metaphors are used throughout communication and think about why those metaphors are effective. Have you ever noticed that the financial business uses water-based metaphors (cash <em class="emphasis">flow</em>, <em class="emphasis">frozen</em> assets, <em class="emphasis">liquidity</em>) and that meteorologists use war terms (<em class="emphasis">fronts</em>, wind <em class="emphasis">force</em>, storm <em class="emphasis">surge</em>)? What kinds of metaphors are used in your area of study?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask.</strong> A creative thinker always questions the way things are: Why are we doing things this way? What were the objectives of this process and the assumptions made when we developed the process? Are they still valid? What if we changed certain aspects? What if our circumstances changed? Would we need to change the process? How? Get in the habit of asking questions—lots of questions.</li>
