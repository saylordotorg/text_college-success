Often this is writing that responds to other writing—to the ideas or controversies that you’ll read about. While this definition sounds simple, academic writing may be very different from other types of writing you have done in the past. Often college students begin to understand what academic writing really means only after they receive negative feedback on their work. To become a strong writer in college, you need to achieve a clear sense of two things:</p>

        <li>The academic environment</li>
        <li>The kinds of writing you’ll be doing in that environment</li>

    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Differences between High School and College Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Students who struggle with writing in college often conclude that their high school teachers were too easy or that their college instructors are too hard. In most cases, neither explanation is fully accurate or fair. A student having difficulty with college writing usually just hasn’t yet made the transition from high school writing to college writing. That shouldn’t be surprising, for many beginning college students do not even know that there is a transition to be made.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p02">In high school, most students think of writing as the subject of English classes. Few teachers in other courses give much feedback on student writing; many do not even assign writing. This says more about high school than about the quality of teachers or about writing itself. High school teachers typically teach five courses a day and often more than 150 students. Those students often have a very wide range of backgrounds and skill levels.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Thus many high school English instructors focus on specific, limited goals. For example, they may teach the “five paragraph essay” as the right way to organize a paper because they want to give every student some idea of an essay’s basic structure. They may give assignments on stories and poems because their own college background involved literature and literary analysis. In classes other than English, many high school teachers must focus on an established body of information and may judge students using tests that measure only how much of this information they acquire. Often writing itself is not directly addressed in such classes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p04">This does not mean that students don’t learn a great deal in high school, but it’s easy to see why some students think that writing is important only in English classes. Many students also believe an academic essay must be five paragraphs long or that “school writing” is usually literary analysis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p05">Think about how college differs from high school. In many colleges, the instructors teach fewer classes and have fewer students. In addition, while college students have highly diverse backgrounds, the skills of college students are less variable than in an average high school class. In addition, college instructors are specialists in the fields they teach, as you recall from <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch07#lochhaas-ch07">Chapter 7 "Interacting with Instructors and Classes"</a>. College instructors may design their courses in unique ways, and they may teach about specialized subjects. For all of these reasons, college instructors are much more likely than high school teachers to</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>assign writing,</li>
            <li>respond in detail to student writing,</li>
            <li>ask questions that cannot be dealt with easily in a fixed form like a five-paragraph essay.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s01_p06">Your transition to college writing could be even more dramatic. The kind of writing you have done in the past may not translate at all into the kind of writing required in college. For example, you may at first struggle with having to write about very different kinds of topics, using different approaches. You may have learned only one kind of writing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">genre</a><span class="glossdef">A kind or type of essay; an approach or a specific form of organization; a compare-and-contrast essay, for example, is a genre often assigned by college instructors.</span></span> (a kind of approach or organization) and now find you need to master other types of writing as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Kinds of Papers Are Commonly Assigned in College Classes?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Think about the topic “gender roles”—referring to expectations about differences in how men and women act. You might study gender roles in an anthropology class, a film class, or a psychology class. The topic itself may overlap from one class to another, but you would not write about this subject in the same way in these different classes. For example, in an anthropology class, you might be asked to describe how men and women of a particular culture divide important duties. In a film class, you may be asked to analyze how a scene portrays gender roles enacted by the film’s characters. In a psychology course, you might be asked to summarize the results of an experiment involving gender roles or compare and contrast the findings of two related research projects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p02">It would be simplistic to say that there are three, or four, or ten, or any number of types of academic writing that have unique characteristics, shapes, and styles. Every assignment in every course is unique in some ways, so don’t think of writing as a fixed form you need to learn. On the other hand, there are certain writing <em class="emphasis">approaches</em> that do involve different kinds of writing. An approach is the way you go about meeting the writing goals for the assignment. The approach is usually signaled by the words instructors use in their assignments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p03">When you first get a writing assignment, pay attention first to keywords for how to approach the writing. These will also suggest how you may structure and develop your paper. Look for terms like these in the assignment:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Summarize.</strong> To restate in your own words the main point or points of another’s work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Define.</strong> To describe, explore, or characterize a keyword, idea, or phenomenon.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Classify.</strong> To group individual items by their shared characteristics, separate from other groups of items.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Compare/contrast.</strong> To explore significant likenesses and differences between two or more subjects.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Analyze.</strong> To break something, a phenomenon, or an idea into its parts and explain how those parts fit or work together.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Argue.</strong> To state a claim and support it with reasons and evidence.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Synthesize.</strong> To pull together varied pieces or ideas from two or more sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p04">Note how this list is similar to the words used in examination questions that involve writing. (See <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06_s04#lochhaas-ch06_s04_s05_t01">Table 6.1 "Words to Watch for in Essay Questions"</a> in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06_s04#lochhaas-ch06_s04">Section 6.4 "The Secrets of the Q and A’s"</a>.) This overlap is not a coincidence—essay exams are an abbreviated form of academic writing such as a class paper.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p05">Sometimes the keywords listed don’t actually appear in the written assignment, but they are usually implied by the questions given in the assignment. “What,” “why,” and “how” are common question words that require a certain kind of response. Look back at the keywords listed and think about which approaches relate to “what,” “why,” and “how” questions.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_l02">
            <li>“What” questions usually prompt the writing of summaries, definitions, classifications, and sometimes compare-and-contrast essays. For example, “<strong class="emphasis bold">What</strong> does Jones see as the main elements of Huey Long’s populist appeal?” or “<strong class="emphasis bold">What</strong> happened when you heated the chemical solution?”</li>
            <li>“Why” and “how” questions typically prompt analysis, argument, and synthesis essays. For example, “<strong class="emphasis bold">Why</strong> did Huey Long’s brand of populism gain force so quickly?” or “<strong class="emphasis bold">Why</strong> did the solution respond the way it did to heat?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p06">Successful academic writing starts with recognizing what the instructor is requesting, or what you are required to do. So pay close attention to the assignment. Sometimes the essential information about an assignment is conveyed through class discussions, however, so be sure to listen for the keywords that will help you understand what the instructor expects. If you feel the assignment does not give you a sense of direction, seek clarification. Ask questions that will lead to helpful answers. For example, here’s a short and very vague assignment:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p07"><em class="emphasis">Discuss the perspectives on religion of Rousseau, Bentham, and Marx. Papers should be four to five pages in length.</em></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p08">Faced with an assignment like this, you could ask about the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scope (or focus)</a><span class="glossdef">A deliberate and purposeful narrowing of coverage. Writers must define specific limitations to work within to narrow the scope or sharpen the focus of their subject.</span></span> of the assignment:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_l03">
            <li>Which of the assigned readings should I concentrate on?</li>
            <li>Should I read other works by these authors that haven’t been assigned in class?</li>
            <li>Should I do research to see what scholars think about the way these philosophers view religion?</li>
            <li>Do you want me to pay equal attention to each of the three philosophers?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p09">You can also ask about the approach the instructor would like you to take. You can use the keywords the instructor may not have used in the assignment:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_l04">
            <li>Should I just <em class="emphasis">summarize</em> the positions of these three thinkers, or should I <em class="emphasis">compare and contrast</em> their views?</li>
            <li>Do you want me to <em class="emphasis">argue</em> a specific point about the way these philosophers approach religion?</li>
            <li>Would it be OK if I <em class="emphasis">classified</em> the ways these philosophers think about religion?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch08_s01_s02_p10">Never just complain about a vague assignment. It is fine to ask questions like these. Such questions will likely engage your instructor in a productive discussion with you.</p>
