        <h2 class="title editable block">Problematic Emotions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_p01">When is an emotion problematic? Is it bad to feel anxious about a big test coming up or to feel sad after breaking up a romantic relationship?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_p02">It is normal to experience negative emotions. College students face so many demands and stressful situations that many naturally report often feeling anxious, depressed, or lonely. These emotions become problematic only when they persist and begin to affect your life in negative ways. That’s when it’s time to work on your emotional health—just as you’d work on your physical health when illness strikes.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Anxiety</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">Feelings of worry, tension, and nervousness with or without a specific focus of concern; severe or persistent anxiety can be a mental disorder.</span></span> is one of the most common emotions college students experience, often as a result of the demands of college, work, and family and friends. It’s difficult to juggle everything, and you may end up feeling not in control, stressed, and anxious.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p02">Anxiety typically results from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stress</a><span class="glossdef">A natural response of the body and mind to a demand or challenge, often associated with feelings of tension and negative emotions.</span></span>. Some anxiety is often a good thing if it leads to studying for a test, focusing on a problem that needs to be resolved, better management your time and money, and so on. But if anxiety disrupts your focus and makes you freeze up rather than take action, then it may become problematic. Using stress-reduction techniques often helps reduce anxiety to a manageable level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p03">Anxiety is easier to deal with when you know its cause. Then you can take steps to gain control over the part of your life causing the anxiety. But anxiety can become excessive and lead to a dread of everyday situations. There are five types of more serious anxiety:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> is characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry and tension, even when there is little or nothing to provoke it. The person may have physical symptoms, especially fatigue, headaches, muscle tension, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, trembling, twitching, irritability, sweating, and hot flashes.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong> is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions), repetitive behaviors (compulsions), or both. Repetitive behaviors such as hand washing, counting, checking, or cleaning are often performed with the hope of preventing obsessive thoughts or making them go away.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Panic disorder</strong> is characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social phobia (or social anxiety disorder)</strong> is a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and being embarrassed or humiliated by one’s own actions. Their fear may be so severe that it interferes with work or school, and other ordinary activities. Physical symptoms often accompany the intense anxiety of social phobia and include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea, and difficulty talking.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p04">These five types of anxiety go beyond the normal anxiety everyone feels at some times. If you feel your anxiety is like any of these, see your health-care provider. Effective treatments are available to help you regain control.</p>

        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Loneliness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Loneliness</a><span class="glossdef">An emotional state of sadness and feeling isolated from or not connected to others.</span></span> is a normal feeling that most people experience at some time. College students away from home for the first time are likely to feel lonely at first. Older students may also feel lonely if they no longer see their old friends. Loneliness involves not feeling connected with others. One person may need only one friend to not feel lonely; others need to feel more connected with a group. There’s no set pattern for feeling lonely.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p02">If you are feeling lonely, there are many things you can do to meet others and feel connected. Don’t sit alone in your room bemoaning the absence of friends. That will only cause more stress and emotional distress. You will likely start making new friends through going to classes, working, studying, and living in the community. But you can jump-start that process by taking active steps such as these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Realize you don’t have to be physically with friends in order to stay connected. Many students use social Web sites to stay connected with friends at other colleges or in other locations. Telephone calls, instant messaging, and e-mail work for many.</li>
                <li>Understand that you’re not alone in feeling lonely. Many others like you are just waiting for the opportunity to connect, and you will meet them and form new friendships fast once you start reaching out.</li>
                <li>Become involved in campus opportunities to meet others. Every college has a wide range of clubs for students with different interests. If you’re not the “joiner” type, look for individuals in your classes with whom you think you may have something in common and ask them if they’d like to study for a test together or work together on a class project.</li>
                <li>Remember that loneliness is a temporary thing—it’s only a matter of time until you make new friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p03">If your loneliness persists and you seem unable to make friends, then it’s a good idea to talk with your counselor or someone at the student health center. They can help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Depression</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Depression</a><span class="glossdef">A despondent emotional state with feelings of pessimism and sometimes feelings of inadequacy; severe or persistent depression affecting one’s daily life can be a mental disorder.</span></span>, like anxiety and loneliness, is commonly experienced by college students. It may be a mild sadness resulting from specific circumstances or be intense feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Many people feel depressed from time to time because of common situations:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>Feeling overwhelmed by pressures to study, work, and meet other obligations</li>
                <li>Not having enough time (or money) to do the things you want to do</li>
                <li>Experiencing problems in a relationship, friendship, or work situation</li>
                <li>Feeling overweight, unhealthy, or not in control of oneself</li>
                <li>Feeling that your new life as a student lacks some of the positive dimensions of your former life</li>
                <li>Not having enough excitement in your life</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_p02">Depression, like stress, can lead to unhealthy consequences such as poor sleep, overeating or loss of appetite, substance abuse, relationship problems, or withdrawal from activities that formerly brought joy. For most people, depression is a temporary state. But severe depression can have crippling effects. Not everyone experiences the same symptoms, but the following are most common:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_l02">
                <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” feelings</li>
                <li>Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism</li>
                <li>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness</li>
                <li>Irritability or restlessness</li>
                <li>Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable, including sex</li>
                <li>Fatigue and decreased energy</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions</li>
                <li>Insomnia, early morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping</li>
                <li>Overeating or appetite loss</li>
                <li>Thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts</li>
                <li>Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_p03">If you have feelings like this that last for weeks at a time and affect your daily life, your depression is more severe than “normal,” temporary depression. It’s time to see your health-care provider and get treatment as you would for any other illness.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Suicidal Feelings</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p01">Severe depression often makes a person feel there is no hope—and therefore many people with depression do not seek help. In reality, depression can be successfully treated, but only if the person seeks help.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p02">Suicidal feelings, which can result from severe depression, are more common in college students than in the past. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death in American college students (after accidents). In most cases, the person had severe depression and was not receiving treatment. Recognizing severe depression and seeking treatment is crucial.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p03">Depression can strike almost anyone at any age at any kind of college. It is a myth that high-pressure colleges have higher suicide rates or that students who feel compelled to excel because of college pressures are more likely to commit suicide. In reality, anyone can be ill with severe depression and, if not treated, become suicidal.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p04">Following are risk factors for suicide:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>Depression and other mental disorders or a substance-abuse disorder (more than 90 percent of people who die by suicide have these risk factors)</li>
                <li>Prior suicide attempt</li>
                <li>Family history of mental disorder, substance abuse, or suicide</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_p01">Emotional balance is an essential element of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wellness</a><span class="glossdef">A state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease.</span></span>—and for succeeding in college. Emotional balance doesn’t mean that you never experience a negative emotion, because these emotions are usually natural and normal. Emotional balance means we balance the negative with the positive, that we can be generally happy even if we’re saddened by some things.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_p02">Emotional balance starts with being aware of our emotions and understanding them. If you’re feeling angry, stop and think about the real cause of your anger. Are you really angry because your friend said something about one of your bad habits, or are you angry because you haven’t been able to break that habit? Are you feeling anxiety because you’re worried you might not be cut out for college, or are you just anxious about that test tomorrow?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_p03">See the “Tips for Success” for other ways you can achieve and maintain a healthy emotional balance.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_l01">
                <li>Accept that most emotions can’t be directly controlled. But the things you do—such as getting exercise, using a relaxation technique, trying the various stress-reduction methods discussed in this chapter—do improve your emotional state.</li>
                <li>Connect with others. Your emotional state is less likely to change when you keep to yourself and “stew over” the feeling.</li>
                <li>Develop your empathy for others. Empathy involves recognizing the emotions that others are feeling. You’ll find yourself in better emotional balance as a result, and your relationships will improve.</li>
                <li>Be honest in your relationships. If you try to hide your feelings, the other person will know something is wrong and may react the wrong way.</li>
                <li>Understand that negative emotions are temporary. You may be feeling bad now, but it will pass in time. But if a negative feeling does last a long time, recognize that you likely need help resolving it—and that help is available.</li>
                <li>If you’ve just become a college student, know that the first term is usually the hardest. Hang in there. Once you’ve developed effective study habits and time management skills, each term will be easier and happier than the one before.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_p01">Romantic relationships are often as much a part of a rich emotional life for college students as for anyone else. But the added challenges of college, especially while also working and maintaining a family life, often stress these relationships. You may have to give extra attention to a relationship to keep it healthy and avoid conflicts that lead to unhappiness and other problems.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Building Relationships</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01_p01">Ideally, a healthy relationship should have these characteristics:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Both partners should respect each other as individuals with unique interests and personality traits. Don’t expect your partner to be just like you; embrace rather than reject differences. Both partners should be supportive of each other.</li>
                <li>Both partners should trust each other and be honest with each other. You must feel that you can open up emotionally to the other without fear of rejection. Starting out with deceptions is certain to cause eventual problems.</li>
                <li>Both partners should be understanding and have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">empathy</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person.</span></span> for each other. Good communication is essential. Many relationship problems are rooted in misunderstandings, such as when one partner doesn’t make the effort to understand what the other wants or needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01_p02">These positive characteristics of a good relationship don’t happen overnight. The relationship may begin with romantic attraction and only slowly develop into a trusting, mutually supportive friendship as well. The following signs may indicate that a dating relationship is not developing well:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01_l02">
                <li>Your partner is pressuring you for sex when you’re not ready</li>
                <li>Your partner seems angry or abusive when you disagree about something</li>
                <li>Your partner seems possessive when others want to spend time with you</li>
                <li>Your partner treats you unequally in any way</li>
                <li>Your partner is emotionally or physically abusive (whether it happens once or many times)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s01_p03">If you recognize that any of these things are happening with someone you’re dating, it may be time to reconsider, even if you still feel attracted. Any relationship that begins this way is not likely to end well.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Resolving Conflicts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p01">In any friendship or relationship, conflict will eventually happen. This is just natural because people are different. If a conflict is ignored, or the partners just argue without resolving it, it may simmer and continue to cause tension, eventually weakening the relationship. It’s better to take steps to resolve it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conflict resolution</a><span class="glossdef">A step-by-step process designed to resolve a dispute or disagreement.</span></span> is a process of understanding what’s really going on and then finding a solution. The same general steps of conflict resolution can work to solve a relationship conflict or a conflict between any people or groups because of a disagreement about anything. Following are the general principles of conflict resolution:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Allow things to cool off.</strong> It’s difficult to resolve a conflict while either party is still emotional. Wait a few minutes or agree to talk about it later.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Using “I statements” rather than “you statements,” each party explains what bothers him or her about the cause of the conflict.</strong> For example, don’t say, “You’re always playing loud music when I’m trying to study.” Instead, say, “I have difficulty studying when you play loud music, and that makes me frustrated and irritable.” “You statements” put the other person on the defensive and evoke emotions that make resolution more difficult.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Listen carefully to what the other person says.</strong> Then restate the message in your own words to give the other a chance to clarify their thoughts and feelings. Each party should listen to the other and restate the other’s message to ensure the real issue is out on the table for discussion.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Accept responsibility for your role in the conflict, instead of blaming the other.</strong> A good example of accepting responsibility is to say, “I know I’m always studying and need the quiet. I guess that makes it hard for you to listen to your music.”</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Brainstorm together to find a solution that satisfies both of you.</strong> Some compromise is usually needed, but that is usually not difficult to reach when you’re calm and are working together on a solution. In this example, you might compromise by going elsewhere to study at selected times when the other has friends over and wants to listen to music, and the other may compromise by agreeing to use headphones at other times and never to play music aloud after 10 p.m.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Apologize, thank, and forgive.</strong> After reaching a resolution, emotional closure is needed to restore your relationship and end on a positive, affirming note. When appropriate, apologize for your past anger or arguing. Thank the other for being willing to compromise to resolve the conflict. In your mind, forgive the person for past misunderstandings and actions so that you do not carry any grudge into the future.</li>

                <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p03">Can your relationship survive if you and your partner are living at a distance? This is a common issue for young people going off to college at different schools—and for older college students, too, who may move because of work or school. Sometimes the relationship survives, and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s important, if you’re making an effort to stay together, for both partners to accept that being apart will add new pressures on the relationship. Accept also that both of you will be changing in many ways. You may naturally grow apart and decide to break up.</p>
                <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p04">Yet often long-distance relationships do survive successfully. If you do decide to work to keep your relationship alive and vibrant, there are things you can do:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_l02">
                    <li>Acknowledge that you are both changing, and accept and celebrate your new lives.</li>
                    <li>Don’t feel guilty about being excited by your new life, and don’t try to pretend to your partner that you’re always miserable because you’re separated.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be upset or jealous when your partner tells you about new friends and activities—be happy that he or she seems happy. Talk about these changes and be happy for each other.</li>
                    <li>If your relationship is solid, it is already based on trust and mutual support, which should continue to give you strength when apart.</li>

We need to connect with others, to be honest and empathetic in our relationships, and to resolve conflicts that can cause bad feelings and threaten our daily happiness.
