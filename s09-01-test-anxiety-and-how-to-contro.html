    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_p02">If you answered true to any of the statements in the table above, you have suffered some of the symptoms of test anxiety. Most of us have experienced this. It is normal to feel stress before an exam, and in fact, that may be a good thing. Stress motivates you to study and review, generates adrenaline to help sharpen your reflexes and focus while taking the exam, and may even help you remember some of the material you need. But suffering too many stress symptoms or suffering any of them severely will impede your ability to show what you have learned. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Test anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">A psychological condition in which a person feels distress before, during, or after a test or exam to the point where stress causes poor performance.</span></span> is a psychological condition in which a person feels distress before, during, or after a test or exam to the point where stress causes poor performance. Anxiety during a test interferes with your ability to recall knowledge from memory as well as your ability to use higher-level thinking skills effectively. To learn more about critical thinking and study skills, see <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch03#lochhaas-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking about Thought"</a> and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>, respectively.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_p03">There are steps you should take if you find that stress is getting in your way:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be prepared.</strong> A primary cause of test anxiety is not knowing the material. If you take good class and reading notes and review them regularly, this stressor should be greatly reduced if not eliminated. You should be confident going into your exam (but not overconfident).</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bounce bad vibes.</strong> Your own negative thoughts—“I’ll never pass this exam” or “I can’t figure this out, I must be really stupid!”—may move you into spiraling stress cycle that in itself causes enough anxiety to block your best efforts. When you feel you are brewing a storm of negative thoughts, stop what you are doing and clear your mind. Allow yourself to daydream a little; visualize yourself in pleasant surroundings with good friends. Don’t go back to work until you feel the tension release. Sometimes it helps to take a deep breath and shout “STOP!” and then proceed with clearing your mind. Once your mind is clear, repeat a reasonable affirmation to yourself—“I know this stuff”—before continuing your work.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visualize success.</strong> Picture what it will feel like to get that A. Translate that vision into specific, reasonable goals and work toward each individual goal. Take one step at a time and reward yourself for each goal you complete.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">It’s all about you!</strong> Don’t waste your time comparing yourself to other students in the class, especially during the exam. Keep focused on your own work and your own plan. Exams are not a race, so it doesn’t matter who turns in their paper first. Certainly you have no idea how they did on their exam, so a thought like “Kristen is already done, she must have aced it, I wish I had her skills” is counterproductive and will only cause additional anxiety.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have a plan and follow it.</strong> As soon as you know that an exam is coming, you can develop a plan for studying. As soon as you get your exam paper, you should develop a plan for the exam itself. We’ll discuss this more later in this chapter. Don’t wait to cram for an exam at the last minute; the pressure you put on yourself and the late night will cause more anxiety, and you won’t learn or retain much.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make sure you eat well and get a good night’s sleep before the exam.</strong> Hunger, poor eating habits, energy drinks, and lack of sleep all contribute to test anxiety.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Chill!</strong> You perform best when you are relaxed, so learn some relaxation exercises you can use during an exam. Before you begin your work, take a moment to listen to your body. Which muscles are tense? Move them slowly to relax them. Tense them and relax them. Exhale, then continue to exhale for a few more seconds until you feel that your lungs are empty. Inhale slowly through your nose and feel your rib cage expand as you do. This will help oxygenate your blood and reenergize your mind. <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a> has more tips for dealing with stress.</li>

        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch06_s01_p04">You’ve learned how negative thoughts contribute to test anxiety and keep you from doing as well as you can. Take some time to disarm your most frequent offenders. From the following list, select three negative thoughts that you have experienced (or write your own).
