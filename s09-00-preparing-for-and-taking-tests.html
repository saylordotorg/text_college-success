        <h2 class="title editable block">Tested at Every Turn</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p01">Testing is a part of life. Have you ever participated in an athletic event? Completed a crossword puzzle? Acted in a play? Cooked dinner? Answered a child’s question? Prepared a cost estimate? All of these common life situations are forms of tests because they measure how much we know about a specific subject at a single point in time. They alone are not good measurements about how smart or gifted you are—they show only how much you know or can do at that moment. We can learn from how we have performed, and we can think about how to apply what we have learned to do even better next time. We can have fun measuring our progress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p02">Many of our daily activities are measurements of progress toward mastery of skills or knowledge. We welcome these opportunities as both work and fun. But when these opportunities are part of our academic life, we often dread them and rarely feel any sense of fun. In reality, however, academic tests are similar to real-life tests in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_l01">
            <li>They help us measure our progress toward mastery of a particular skill.</li>
            <li>They are not a representation of how smart, talented, or skilled we are but rather are a measurement only of what we know about a specific subject at a specific point in time.</li>
            <li>They are extraordinary learning opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p03">Academic tests in college are different from those you took in high school. College instructors expect to see much more of <em class="emphasis">you</em> in an exam: your thoughts, your interpretations, your thinking process, your conclusions. High school teachers usually look for your ability to repeat precisely what you read in your text or heard in your class. Success on high school tests relies much more on memorization than on understanding the material. This is why you need to modify your study habits and your strategies for taking exams in college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p04">Take a look at the learning cycle in <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch06_s00_f01">Figure 6.2 "The Learning Cycle: Review and Apply"</a>. In this chapter, we cover reviewing and applying the material you learn; preparing for and taking exams is the practical application of this phase.</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.2</span> The Learning Cycle: Review and Apply</p>
            <img src="section_09/667bc7b9e448f3f46be5e854899711e4.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p05">The end and the beginning of the learning cycle are both involved in test taking, as we’ll see in this chapter. We will discuss the best study habits for effective review and strategies for successful application of your knowledge in tests and exams. Finally, we will cover how the review and application processes set you up for additional learning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p06">Let’s start at the top of the cycle. You have invested your time in preparing for class, you have been an active listener in class, and you have asked questions and taken notes. You have summarized what you learned and have looked for opportunities to apply the material. You have completed your reading assignments and compared your reading notes with your class notes. And now you hear your instructor say, “Remember the exam next week.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s00_p07">A sense of dread takes over. You worry about the exam and what might be on it. You stay up for a couple of nights trying to work through the volumes of material the course has covered. Learning or remembering it all seems hopeless. You find yourself staring at the same paragraph in your text over and over again, but you just don’t seem to get it. As the exam looms closer, you feel your understanding of the material is slipping away. You show up to the exam and the first questions look familiar, but then you draw a blank—you’re suffering from test anxiety.</p>
