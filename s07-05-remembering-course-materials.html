        <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Memorization in Learning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s01_p01">Have you ever gone into an exam you have studied for and drawn a blank on a particular question? Have you ever walked into a room only to forget for a moment why you went there? Have you ever forgotten where you left your keys? How about finding yourself in a conversation with someone whose name you can’t remember? The fact is, memory fails everyone from time to time. It is not surprising that students, with a huge amount of information they must commit to memory (not to mention frequent distractions and interruptions), are often frustrated by their memory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s01_p02">Let’s start by taking some of the pressure off you. You will not be required to memorize everything your instructor says in a class—nor should you try to. There is way too much to capture. People speak at a rate of 100 to 150 words per minute. An average 50-minute lecture may contain around 7,500 words. By listening effectively and taking notes, your job is to distill the main ideas and a few keywords. <em class="emphasis">These</em> are the things you should choose to memorize.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s01_p03">In your early and high school education, memorization was a key aspect of learning. You memorized multiplication tables, the names of the states, and vocabulary words. Memorized facts ensured your success on multiple-choice questions. In college, however, most of your work is focused on understanding the material in depth. Remembering the year of the 9/11 attack (2001) is far less important than grasping the impact of that attack on American foreign policy. Understanding themes and ideas and being able to think critically about them is really the key to your success in college learning. For more on critical thinking skills, see <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch03#lochhaas-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking about Thought"</a>. Although memorization is not the primary key to success, having a good memory is important to capture ideas in your mind, and it helps tremendously in certain subjects like sciences and foreign languages.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Memory Works</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Memory</a><span class="glossdef">The process of storing and retrieving information.</span></span> is the process of storing and retrieving information. Think of a computer. In many ways it is an electronic model of the human memory. A computer stores, retrieves, and processes information similarly to how the human mind does. Like the human version, there are two types of memory: short-term or active memory (RAM in the computer) and long-term or passive memory (the computer’s hard drive). As its name suggests, short-term or active memory is made up of the information we are processing at any given time. Short-term memory involves information being captured at the moment (such as listening in class) as well as from information retrieved from our passive memory for doing complex mental tasks (such as thinking critically and drawing conclusions). But short-term memory is limited and suffers from the passing of time and lack of use. We begin to forget data within thirty seconds of not using it, and interruptions (such as phone calls or distractions) require us to rebuild the short-term memory structure—to get “back on task.” Learn more about multitasking in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>. To keep information in our memory, we must either use it or place it into our long-term memory (much like saving a document on your computer).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s02_p02">How we save information to our long-term memory has a lot to do with our ability to retrieve it when we need it at a later date. Our mind “saves” information by creating a complex series of links to the data. The stronger the links, the easier it is to recall. You can strengthen these links by using the following strategies. You should note how closely they are tied to good listening and note-taking strategies.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make a deliberate decision to remember the specific data.</strong> “I need to remember Richard’s name” creates stronger links than just wishing you had a better memory for names.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Link the information to your everyday life.</strong> Ask yourself, “Why is it important that I remember this material?”—and answer it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Link the information to other information you already have “stored,”</strong> especially the key themes of the course, and you will recall the data more easily. Ask yourself how this is related to other information you have. Look for ways to tie items together. Are they used in similar ways? Do they have similar meanings? Do they sound alike?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mentally group similar individual items into “buckets.”</strong> By doing this, you are creating links, for example, among terms to be memorized. For example, if you have to memorize a vocabulary list for a Spanish class, group the nouns together with other nouns, verbs with verbs, and so forth. Or your groupings might be sentences using the vocabulary words.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use visual imagery.</strong> Picture the concept vividly in your mind. Make those images big, bold, and colorful—even silly! Pile concepts on top of each other or around each other; exaggerate their features like a caricature; let your imagination run wild. Humor and crazy imagery can help you recall key concepts.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use the information.</strong> Studies have generally shown that we retain only 5 percent of what we hear, 10 percent of what we read, 20 percent of what we learn from multimedia, and 30 percent of what is demonstrated to us, but we do retain 50 percent of what we discuss, 75 percent of what we practice by doing, and 90 percent of what we teach others or use immediately in a relevant activity. Review your notes, participate in class, and study with others.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Break information down into manageable “chunks.”</strong> Memorizing the ten-digit number “3141592654” seems difficult, but breaking it down into two sets of three digits and one of four digits, like a phone number—(314) 159-2654—now makes it easier to remember. (Pat yourself on the back if you recognized that series of digits: with a decimal point after the three, that’s the value of pi to ten digits. Remember your last math class?)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Work from general information to the specific.</strong> People usually learn best when they get the big picture first, and then look at the details.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Eliminate distractions.</strong> Every time you have to “reboot” your short-term memory, you risk losing data points. Multitasking—listening to music or chatting on Facebook while you study—will play havoc with your ability to memorize because you will need to reboot your short-term memory each time you switch mental tasks.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Repeat, repeat, repeat.</strong> Hear the information; read the information; say it (yes, out loud), and say it again. The more you use or repeat the information, the stronger the links to it. The more senses you use to process the information, the stronger the memorization. Write information on index cards to make flash cards and use downtime (when waiting for the subway or during a break between classes) to review key information.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">This is a test.</strong> Test your memory often. Try to write down everything you know about a specific subject, from memory. Then go back and check your notes and textbook to see how you did. Practicing retrieval in this way helps ensure long-term learning of facts and concepts.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Location, location, location.</strong> There is often a strong connection between information and the place where you first received that information. Associate information to learning locations for stronger memory links. Picture where you were sitting in the lecture hall as you repeat the facts in your mind.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_p01">What do the names of the Great Lakes, the makings of a Big Mac, and the number of days in a month have in common? They are easily remembered by using mnemonic devices. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mnemonics</a><span class="glossdef">Tricks for memorizing lists and data.</span></span> (pronounced neh-MA-nicks) are tricks for memorizing lists and data. They create artificial but strong links to the data, making recall easier. The most commonly used mnemonic devices are acronyms, acrostics, rhymes, and jingles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Acronyms</a><span class="glossdef">A word formed from the initial letters of words in a phrase or series of words, such as “USA” for “United States of America.”</span></span> are words or phrases made up by using the first letter of each word in a list or phrase. Need to remember the names of the Great Lakes? Try the acronym HOMES using the first letter of each lake:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_l01">

<strong class="emphasis bold">H</strong>uron</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_p03">To create an acronym, first write down the first letters of each term you need to memorize. Then rearrange the letters to create a word or words. You can find acronym generators online (just search for “acronym generator”) that can help you by offering options. Acronyms work best when your list of letters includes vowels as well as consonants and when the order of the terms is not important. If no vowels are available, or if the list should be learned in a particular order, try using an acrostic instead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Acrostics</a><span class="glossdef">A mnemonic method in which words in a sentence or phrase work as memory aids for something beginning with the same first letters in the acrostic.</span></span> are similar to acronyms in that they work off the first letter of each word in a list. But rather than using them to form a word, the letters are represented by entire words in a sentence or phrase. If you’ve studied music, you may be familiar with “Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge” to learn the names of the notes on the lines of the musical staff: E, G, B, D, F. The ridiculous and therefore memorable line “My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas” was used by many of us to remember the names of the planets (at least until Pluto was downgraded):</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch04_s05_s03_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rhymes</a><span class="glossdef">Short verses used to remember data.</span></span> are short verses used to remember data. A common example is “In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.” Need to remember how many days a given month has? “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November…,” and so forth. Writing rhymes is a talent that can be developed with practice. To start, keep your rhymes short and simple. Define the key information you want to remember and break it down into a series of short phrases. Look at the last words of the phrases: can you rhyme any of them? If they don’t rhyme, can you substitute or add a word to create the rhyme? (For example, in the Columbus rhyme, “ninety-two” does not rhyme with “ocean,” but adding the word “blue” completes the rhyme and creates the mnemonic.)</p>

Jingles are commonly used by advertisers to get you to remember their product or product features. Remember “Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun”—the original Big Mac commercial. Anytime you add rhythm to the terms you want to memorize, you are activating your auditory sense, and the more senses you use for memorization, the stronger the links to the data you are creating in your mind. To create a jingle for your data, start with a familiar tune and try to create alternate lyrics using the terms you want to memorize. Another approach you may want to try is reading your data aloud in a hip-hop or rap music style.</p>
