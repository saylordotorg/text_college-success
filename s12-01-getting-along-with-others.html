        <h2 class="title editable block">Interdependence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Humans are social creatures—it’s simply in our nature. We continually interact with other students and instructors, and we can learn a great deal from these interactions that heighten the learning process. This frequent interaction with others forms a state of interdependence. College students depend on their instructors, but just as importantly, they depend on other students in many ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p02">As important as our interactions with others are, we do not automatically possess the skills that help us form good relationships and make the most of our experiences. Consider how these two college students are different:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p03">John often arrives just as class is beginning and leaves immediately afterward. He makes little effort to talk with other students in the classroom, and after class he goes off to study alone or to his part-time job, where he spends most of his time at a computer screen. He is diligent in his studies and generally does well. After two months, he has not gotten to know his roommate very well, and he generally eats alone with a book in hand. He stops by to see his instructors in their offices only if he missed a class due to illness, and on weekends and holidays he often hangs out at his parents’ house or sees old friends.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p04">Kim likes to get to class early and sits near others so they can talk about the reading for class or compare notes about assignments. She enjoys running into other students she knows from her classes and usually stops to chat. Although she is an older working student who lives alone off campus, she often dines in a campus café and asks students she meets in her classes to join her. After two months, with the approach of midterms, she formed a study group with a couple other students. If she feels she doesn’t understand an important lecture topic very well, she gets to her instructor’s office a few minutes ahead of office hours to avoid missing out by having to wait in line. A few weeks into the term, she spent a weekend with a student from another country and learned much about a culture about which she had previously known little.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p05">These students are very different. Which do you think is more fully enjoying the college experience? Which do you think is more likely to do well academically? Most of us fall somewhere between these two extremes, but we can learn to be more like Kim and more actively engage with others.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Recognize the Value of Social Interaction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_p01">Building good relationships is important for happiness and a successful college experience. College offers the opportunity to meet many people you would likely not meet otherwise in life. Make the most of this opportunity to gain a number of benefits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>A growing understanding of diverse other people, how they think, and what they feel that will serve you well throughout your life and in your future career</li>
            <li>A heightened sense of your own identity, especially as you interact with others with different personalities and from different backgrounds</li>
            <li>Emotional comfort from friendship with someone who understands you and with whom you can talk about your problems, joys, hopes, and fears</li>
            <li>An opportunity to grow with wider intellectual and emotional horizons</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_p02">College often offers an opportunity to be stimulated and excited by new relationships and interactions with people who will challenge your thinking and help you become your best. Still, it can be difficult to get started with new relationships in college.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Making New Friends</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p01">Some people just make friends naturally, but many first-year college students are more shy or quiet and may need to actively seek new friends. Here are some starting points:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep all doors open for meeting new people.</strong> If you live in a dorm, literally keep the door open. Try to sit with different people at meals so you can get to know them better. Study in a common area or lounge where you’ll be among others.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be open in your interests.</strong> Don’t limit yourself to people who share only certain interests. Meeting people by studying together is an excellent way to get to know people with different interests.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t try to get involved in everything going on around you.</strong> Committing to too many activities or joining too many social groups will spread your time too thin, and you may not spend enough time with anyone to get to know them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Let others see who you really are.</strong> Let people get to know the things you’re interested in, your real passions. People who really know you are more likely to become good friends.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make an effort to get to know others, too.</strong> Show some interest. Don’t talk just about <em class="emphasis">your</em> interests—ask them about theirs. Show others that you’re interested, that you think they’re worth spending time with, and that you really do want to get to know them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Once a friendship has started, be a good friend.</strong> Respect your friends for what they are and don’t criticize them or talk about them behind their back. Give emotional support when your friends need it and accept their support as well when you need it.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Are You Shy?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p02">If you’re shy, try meeting and talking to people in situations where you can interact one-to-one, such as talking with another student after class. Start with what you have in common—“How’d you do on the test?”—and let the conversation grow from there. Avoid the emotional trap of thinking everyone but you is making new friends and start some conversations with others who look interesting to you. You’ll soon find other “shy” or quiet people eager to interact with you as well and get to know you.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p03">Shy people may be more likely to feel lonely at times, especially while still feeling new at college. Loneliness is usually a temporary emotional state, however. For tips for how to overcome feelings of loneliness, see the section on loneliness in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10_s06#lochhaas-ch10_s06">Section 10.6 "Emotional Health and Happiness"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Skills</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p01">Communication is at the core of almost all social interactions, including those involved in friendships and relationships with your instructors. Communication with others has a huge effect on our lives, what we think and feel, and what and how we learn. Communication is, many would say, what makes us human.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p02">Oral communication involves not only speech and listening, of course, but also <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonverbal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that occurs outside of the written and spoken word, including meanings inferred from facial expressions and body positions.</span></span>: facial expressions, tone of voice, and many other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">body language</a><span class="glossdef">Another term for forms of nonverbal communication, including gestures, postures, and facial expressions.</span></span> signals that affect the messages sent and received. Many experts think that people pay more attention, often unconsciously, to <em class="emphasis">how</em> people say something than to <em class="emphasis">what</em> they are saying. When the nonverbal message is inconsistent with the verbal (spoken) message, just as when the verbal message itself is unclear because of poorly chosen words or vague explanations, then miscommunication may occur.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p03">Miscommunication is at the root of many misunderstandings among people and makes it difficult to build relationships.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p04"><a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch07#lochhaas-ch07">Chapter 7 "Interacting with Instructors and Classes"</a> discusses oral communication skills in general and guidelines for communicating well with your instructors. The same communication skills are important for building and maintaining significant relationships.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p05">Remember that communication is a two-way process. Listening skills are critical for most college students simply because many of us may not have learned how to really listen to another person. Here are some guidelines for how to listen effectively:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Talk less to listen more.</strong> Most people naturally like to share their thoughts and feelings, and some people almost seem unable to stop talking long enough to ever listen to another person. Try this: next time you’re in a conversation with another student, deliberately try not to speak very much but give the other person a chance to speak fully. You may notice a big difference in how much you gain from the conversation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask questions.</strong> To keep the conversational ball rolling, show your interest in the other person by asking them about things they are saying. This helps the other person feel that you are interested in them and helps build the relationship.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Watch and respond to the other person’s body language.</strong> You’ll learn much more about their feelings for what they’re saying than if you listen only to their words.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Show the other person that you’re really listening and that you care.</strong> Make eye contact and respond appropriately with nods and brief comments like “That’s interesting!” or “I know what you mean” or “Really?” Be friendly, smile when appropriate, and encourage the person to keep speaking.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Give the other person</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">feedback</a><span class="glossdef">Evaluative information derived from a person’s reaction or response to a particular activity, such as from a listener’s response to a speaker.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> Show you understand by saying things like “So you’re saying that…” or asking a question that demonstrates you’ve been following what they’re saying and want to know more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p06">As you learn to improve your listening skills, think also about what you are saying yourself and how. Here are additional guidelines for effective speaking:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be honest, but don’t be critical</strong>. Strongly disagreeing may only put the other person on the defensive—an emotion sure to disrupt the hope for good communication. You can disagree, but be respectful to keep the conversation from becoming emotional. Say “I don’t know, I think that maybe it’s…” instead of “That’s crazy! What’s <em class="emphasis">really</em> going on is.…”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look for common ground.</strong> Make sure that your side of a conversation relates to what the other person is saying and that it focuses on what you have in common. There’s almost no better way to stop a conversation dead in its tracks than to ignore everything the other person has just said and launch into an unrelated story or idea of your own.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid sarcasm and irony unless you know the person well.</strong> Sarcasm is easily misunderstood and may be interpreted as an attack on the other person’s ideas or statements.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t try to talk like the other person,</strong> especially if the person is from a different ethnic or cultural background or speaks with an accent or heavy slang. The other person will feel that you are imitating them and maybe even making fun of them. Be yourself and speak naturally.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">While not imitating the other person, relate to his or her personality and style of thinking.</strong> We do not speak to our parents or instructors the exact same way we speak to our closest friends, nor should we speak to someone we’ve just met the same way. Show your respect for the other person by keeping the conversation on an appropriate level.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Remember that</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assertive communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that is self-assured, positive, and honest but still tactful and nonaggressive.</span></span> <strong class="emphasis bold">is better than passive or aggressive communication.</strong> “Assertive” in this context means you are honest and direct in stating your ideas and thoughts; you are confident and clear and willing to discuss your ideas while still respecting the thoughts and ideas of others. A passive communicator is reluctant to speak up, seems to agree with everything others say, hesitates to say anything that others might disagree with, and therefore seldom communicates much at all. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Passive communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication characterized by acceptance of things expressed by others, without taking an active or confident role in sharing one’s own ideas or thoughts.</span></span> simply is not a real exchange in communication. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Aggressive communication</a><span class="glossdef">One-sided communication in which a speaker attacks what others say or uses a pushy, domineering style to express ideas or thoughts.</span></span>, at the other extreme, is often highly critical of the thoughts and ideas of others. This communication style may be sarcastic, emotional, and even insulting. Real communication is not occurring because others are not prompted to respond honestly and openly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose your conversations wisely.</strong> Recognize that you don’t have to engage in all conversations. Make it your goal to form relationships and engage in interactions that help you learn and grow as a person. College life offers plenty of opportunities for making relationships and interacting with others if you keep open to them, so you needn’t try to participate in every social situation around you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p07">Some students may have difficulty in the opposite direction: their social lives may become so rich or so time consuming that they have problems balancing their social lives with their schoolwork. Online social media, for example, may eat up a lot of time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Online Social Networking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p01">Most college students know all about Facebook, Twitter, blogging, chat rooms, and other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social networking</a><span class="glossdef">The use of a Web site to connect with people who share personal or professional interests.</span></span> sites. Current studies reveal that over 90 percent of all college students use Facebook or MySpace regularly, although older students use these sites less commonly. The media have often emphasized negative stories involving safety concerns, obsessive behavior, a perceived superficiality of social interaction online, and so on. But more recently, online social networking has been found to have several benefits. Many of those who once criticized Facebook and MySpace are now regularly networking among themselves via LinkedIn, Plaxo, and other “professional” networking sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p02">Following are some of the benefits of Facebook—some clear to those using it, others revealed only recently by research in the social sciences:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>Facebook and other forms of online networking makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family at a geographical distance. College students who have moved away from former friends seem to make the transition more easily when they stay in touch. Maintaining past relationships does not prevent most people from making new friends at college.</li>
            <li>Facebook provides users with increased “social capital,” which is a sum of resources gained through one’s relationships with people. Facebook users gain information, opportunities for participation in activities and groups, greater knowledge about others, some interaction skills, and so forth. Social capital is also associated with self-esteem, success in some endeavors, and general happiness.</li>
            <li>Facebook makes it easier for people who are shy or otherwise slow to initiate or respond to interactions with others to participate socially in a group. Online network sites also offer an outlet for self-expression and sharing.</li>
            <li>For many college students, interactions on Facebook strengthen personal relationships rather than detracting from them.</li>
            <li>Acknowledging that online social networking is a reality for most college students, many college administrators and instructors also use it to stay in better touch with students, to provide information and encouragement, and to help students experience the full richness of the college experience. Your college may have a Facebook page where you can learn much about things happening around campus, and you may even receive tweets about important announcements.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_f01">

            <img src="section_12/24ddd8fc65446bed3b1e5c3fb786c6b5.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p03">Still, online social networking is not 100 percent beneficial for all college students. Someone who becomes obsessed with constantly updating their profile or attracting a huge number of friends can spend so much time at their computer that they miss out on other important aspects of college life. Hopefully by now everyone knows why you should never post compromising or inappropriate photos or information about yourself anywhere online, even as a joke: many employers, college admissions offices, and others may find this compromising material in the future and deny you the job, internship, graduate program, or other position that you want. It’s important also to protect your identity and privacy on online sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p04">Overall, online networking in moderation can help enrich one’s life. When used to build relationships, gain information, and stay in touch with a larger community, it can contribute to success in college. Most college students use Facebook ten to thirty minutes a day. If you’re spending more than that, you might ask yourself if you’re missing out on something else.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Balancing Schoolwork and Social Life</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_p01">If there’s one thing true of virtually all college students, it’s that you don’t have enough time to do everything you want. Once you’ve developed friendships within the college community and have an active social life, you may feel you don’t have enough time for your studies and other activities such as work. For many students, the numerous social opportunities of college become a distraction, and with less attention to one’s studies, academic performance can drop. Here are some tips for balancing your social life with your studies:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep working on your time management skills,</strong> as you learned in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>. You can’t just “go with the flow” and hope that, after spending time with friends, you have enough time (and energy) left over for studying. Make a study schedule that provides enough time for what you need to do. Study first; socialize after.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep working on your study skills,</strong> as you learned in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch05#lochhaas-ch05">Chapter 5 "Reading to Learn"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>. When you have only a limited amount of time for studying, be sure you’re using that time as effectively as possible as you read assignments and prepare for class, organize your notes after class, and prepare for tests.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you can’t resist temptations, reduce them.</strong> If you are easily distracted by the opportunity to talk with your roommate, spouse, or family members because you study where you live, then go to the library to study.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make studying a social experience.</strong> If your studying keeps you so busy that you feel like you don’t have much of a social life, form a study group. You will learn more than you would alone by gaining from the thoughts of others, and you can enjoy interacting with others without falling behind.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your social life from affecting your studying.</strong> Simply scheduling study time doesn’t mean you’ll use it well. If you stayed up late the night before, you may not today be able to concentrate well as you study for that big test. This is another reason for good time management and scheduling your time well, looking ahead.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get help if you need it.</strong> If you’re still having difficulty balancing your study time with other activities, talk with your academic advisor or a counselor. Maybe something else is keeping you from doing your best. Maybe you need some additional study skills or you need to get some extra help from a tutor or campus study center. Remember, your college wants you to succeed and will try to help those who seek help.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_s01_p01">Fraternities and sororities appeal to many students on many campuses. You meet a lot of people quickly and have a social life provided for you almost automatically, with many events and parties as well as usually an active house life. Many people have formed lasting, even lifelong relationships with their fraternity and sorority friends. On the other hand, this living and social experience may limit the kinds of people you meet and present fewer opportunities to interact with others outside the Greek system. If there are frequent activities, it may be important to learn to say no at time when studying becomes a priority. If you are interested in but not yet committed to this life, it’s worthwhile to find out what the houses at your school are really like, consider what your life would likely be like in a fraternity or sorority, and think about how it may impact your college goals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p01">Conflicts among people who are interacting are natural. People have many differences in opinions, ideas, emotions, and behaviors, and these differences sometimes cause conflicts.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p02">So how can such conflicts be resolved? Two things are necessary for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflict resolution</a><span class="glossdef">A step-by-step process designed to resolve a dispute or disagreement.</span></span> that does not leave one or more of the people involved feeling negative about the outcome: attitude and communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p03">A conflict cannot be resolved satisfactorily unless all people involved have the right attitude:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Respect the options and behaviors of others.</strong> Accept that people are not all alike and learn to celebrate your differences. Most situations do not involve a single right or wrong answer.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be open minded.</strong> Just because at first you are sure that that you are right, do not close the door to other possibilities. Look at the other’s point of view. Be open to change—even when that means accepting constructive criticism.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Calm down.</strong> You can’t work together to resolve a conflict while you’re still feeling strong emotions. Agree with the other to wait until you’re both able to discuss it without strong emotions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recognize the value of compromise.</strong> Even if you disagree after calmly talking over an issue, accept that as a human reality and understand that a compromise may be necessary in order to get along with others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p04">With the right attitude, you can then work together to resolve the issue. This process depends on good communication:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_l03">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Listen.</strong> Don’t simply argue for your position, but listen carefully to what the other says. Pay attention to their body language as you try to understand their point of view and ask questions to ensure that you do. Paraphrase what you think you hear to give the other a chance to correct any misunderstanding.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use “I statements” rather than “you statements.”</strong> Explain your point of view about the situation in a way that does not put the other person on the defensive and evoke emotions that make resolution more difficult. Don’t say, “You’re always playing loud music when I’m trying to study.” Instead, say, “I have difficulty studying when you play loud music, and that makes me frustrated and irritable.” Don’t blame the other for the problem—that would just get emotions flowing again.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Brainstorm together to find a solution that satisfies both of you.</strong> Some compromise is usually needed, but that is usually not difficult to reach when you’re calm and have the right attitude about working together on a solution. In some cases, you may simply have to accept a result that you still do not agree with, simply in order to move on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p05">The process of conflict resolution is discussed more fully in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>. In most cases, when the people involved have a good attitude and are open to compromise, conflicts can be resolved successfully.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p06">Yet sometimes there seems to be no resolution. Sometimes the other person may simply be difficult and refuse to even try to work out a solution. Regrettably, not everyone on or off campus is mature enough to be open to other perspectives. With some interpersonal conflicts, you may simply have to decide not to see that person anymore or find other ways to avoid the conflict in the future. But remember, most conflicts can be solved among adults, and it’s seldom a good solution to run away from a problem that will continue to surface and keep you from being happy with your life.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Roommate Issues</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p01">At many colleges students just out of high school must live in a campus residence hall. Other students may live in a shared apartment with new roommates. This is the first time many students have had to share a room, suite, or apartment with others who were not family members, and this situation may lead to conflicts and strong feelings that can even affect your academic success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p02">As in other interactions, the keys to forming a good relationship with a roommate are communication and attitude. From the beginning, you should talk about everyone’s expectations of the other(s) and what matters most to you about where you live. Don’t wait until problems happen before talking. It’s often good to begin with the key practical issues: agreeing on quiet hours for study (limiting not only loud music but also visits from others), time for lights out, neatness and cleaning up, things shared and private things not to touch.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p03">Show respect for the other’s ideas and possessions, respect their privacy, and try to listen more than you talk. Even if your roommate does not become a close friend, you can have a harmonious, successful relationship that makes your residence a good home for both of you. Millions of college students before you have learned to work this out, and if both (or all) of you respect each other and keep communication open and nonconfrontational, you will easily get through the small bumps in the road ahead, too. Follow these guidelines to help ensure you get along well:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Anticipate problems before they happen.</strong> Think about things that you consider essential in your living environment and talk with a new roommate about these essentials now.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Deal with any problem promptly.</strong> Don’t wait until a behavior is well established before speaking up, as if the other person will somehow catch on that it aggravates you. It may be as simple as a roommate using your coffee cup or borrowing your toothpaste without asking, but if you say nothing, trying to be polite, the habit may expand to other things.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be patient, flexible, and willing to compromise.</strong> It may take a while for each of you to get used to each other and to establish a communication pattern of openness so that you can be honest with each other about what really matters.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be warm, use humor, and be sensitive.</strong> Telling someone that they’re doing something bothersome can be very difficult for many people. Think before speaking, looking for the best way to communicate what you feel. Remember, you’ll be spending a lot of time around this person, so do you really want them to think of you as bossy or obsessive-compulsive?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get out more.</strong> Sometimes it helps to spend more time elsewhere on campus, studying in the library or another quiet place. You just might need a certain amount of time a day alone. That’s fine, but don’t expect your roommate to have to leave just to give you that time alone!</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s02_p01">In some situations and with some people who will not compromise and do not respect you and your needs, a roommate can be a serious problem. In some circumstances, you may able to move to a different room. Room changes usually are not granted simply because you “don’t get along,” but certain circumstances may justify a change. The following are some examples:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s02_l01">
                <li>Your roommate smokes in the room.</li>

                <li>Your roommate repeatedly refuses to limit activities at any hour to allow you to sleep.</li>
                <li>Your roommate does anything that threatens your physical well-being or safety.</li>
                <li>Your roommate denies you your rights to practice your religion or other basic rights.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s02_p02">If you have a problem like this, first talk with your resident advisor (RA) or other residence hall authority. They will explain the process for a room change, if warranted, or other ways for managing the problem,</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dealing with Harassment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p01">Although college campuses are for the most part safe, secure, and friendly places where social and intellectual interaction is generally mature and responsible, harassment can occur in any setting. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Harassment</a><span class="glossdef">Actions or words meant to disturb, belittle, or torment another person.</span></span> is a general term referring to behavior that is intended to disturb or threaten another person in some way, often psychologically. Typically the person or people doing the harassment target their victim because of a difference in race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sex, age, sexual orientation, or disability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p02">Acts of harassment may be verbal, physical, psychological, or any other behavior intended to disturb another person. Bullying behavior, name-calling, belittling, gesturing obscenely, stalking, mobbing—any action intended to torment or deliberately make another person uncomfortable or feel humiliated is harassment. Harassment may also be intended to manipulate a targeted person to act in some specific way.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p03">Sexual harassment is a special term referring to persistent, unwanted sexual behaviors or advances. Sexual harassment may begin with words but progress to unwanted touching and potentially even rape. Sexual harassment is discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p04">Many types of harassment are illegal. In the workplace, a supervisor who tells off-color sexual jokes around an employee of the opposite gender may be guilty of sexual harassment. Students who deliberately malign members of another race may be guilty of committing a hate crime. Physically tormenting another student in a hazing may be judged assault and battery. Any discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, age, sex, and so on is illegal. On a college campus, any harassment of a student by a faculty member or college employee is expressly forbidden, unethical, and also possibly illegal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p05">Harassment of any type, at any time, of any person, is wrong and unacceptable. You will know it if you are harassed, and you should know also that it is your basic right to be free of harassment and that your college has strict policies against all forms of harassment. Here’s what you should do if you are being harassed:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_l01">
            <li>Tell the person to stop the behavior—or if you feel at any risk of harm, get out of the situation immediately.</li>
            <li>Document the incident, particularly with ongoing harassment. Keep notes of the details. Tell someone you trust about the situation.</li>
            <li>Report the harassment to the appropriate college authority. If you are unsure which to go to, go to the dean of students first.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Family Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_p01">The college years are a time of many changes, including one’s relationships with parents, siblings, and one’s own children and partners. Any time there is change, issues may arise.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_p02">As in other relationships, try to understand the other’s perspective. Honesty is particularly important—but with tact and understanding. Here are some tips for getting along:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_l01">
            <li>Understand that your parents may not change their attitudes toward you as quickly as you yourself may be changing. They may still think of you as a younger person in need of their continued guidance. They will worry about you and fear that you might fall in with the wrong crowd or engage in risky behavior. Be patient. Take the time to communicate, and don’t close yourself off. Let them gradually accept you as a more mature person who can make your own decisions wisely.</li>
            <li>Stay in touch. You may be busier than ever and feel you haven’t time for a phone call or e-mail, but communication is very important for parents—especially if they are now empty nesters without other children at home. Even if they seem to want too much involvement in your life and to make decisions for you, realize that this at least in part is simply a desire to stay in touch with you—and to feel they still matter in your life.</li>
            <li>Use your best listening skills. Understanding what they’re really feeling, which is often simply a concern for you born of their love for you, will usually help you know best to respond.</li>
            <li>Be assured that over time your parents and other family members will get used to your being on your own and will accept your ability to make your own decisions. Time itself often solves issues.</li>
            <li>With your own family, now that you are busier than ever with classes and work, you may need to pay special attention to ensuring you stay active in family relationships. Schedule times for family outings and make room in your days for casual interactions. But remember, it’s not how much time you spend together but the quality of that time, so give your family your full attention when you are together.</li>
