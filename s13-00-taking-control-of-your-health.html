        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p01">Health and wellness are important for everyone—students included. Not only will you do better in school when your health is good, but you’ll be happier as a person. And the habits you develop now will likely persist for years to come. That means that what you’re doing now in terms of personal health will have a huge influence on your health throughout life and can help you avoid many serious diseases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p02">Considerable research has demonstrated that the basic elements of good health—nutrition, exercise, not abusing substances, stress reduction—are important for preventing disease. You’ll live much longer and happier than someone without good habits. Here are a few of the health problems whose risks can be lowered by healthful habits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_l01">
            <li>Cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and strokes (the numbers one and three causes of death)</li>
            <li>Some cancers</li>
            <li>Diabetes (currently reaching epidemic proportions)</li>
            <li>Lung diseases related to smoking</li>
            <li>Injuries related to substance abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p03">Wellness is more than just avoiding disease. Wellness involves feeling good in every respect, in mind and spirit as well as in body. Good health habits also offer these benefits for your college career:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_l02">
            <li>More energy</li>
            <li>Better ability to focus on your studies</li>
            <li>Less stress, feeling more resilient and able to handle day-to-day stress</li>
            <li>Less time lost to colds, flu, infections, and other illnesses</li>
            <li>More restful sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p04">This chapter examines a wide range of topics, from nutrition, exercise, and sleep to substance abuse and risks related to sexual activity. All of these involve personal attitudes and behaviors. And they are all linked together to one of the biggest problems students face: stress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p05">Everyone knows about stress, but not everyone knows how to control it. Stress is the great enemy of college success. But once you’ve learned how to reduce it where you can and cope with unavoidable stress, you’ll be well on the road to becoming the best student you can be.</p>
