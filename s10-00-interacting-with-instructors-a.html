        <h2 class="title editable block">Interacting with the College Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_p01">Throughout this text you have been reading about how success in college depends on your active participation in the learning process. Much of what you get out of your education is what you yourself put into it. This chapter considers how to engage in the learning process through interactions with your instructors and other students. Students who actively interact with others in the educational experience are much more successful than passive students who do not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_p02">Yet relatively few college students consistently interact with their instructors and other students in class. Typically only five to seven students in a class, regardless of the class’s size, do most of the participating. Why is that? If you’re just too shy, you can learn to feel comfortable participating.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_p03">Interacting with instructors and participating in class discussions with other students is among the most important steps you can take to make sure you’re successful in college. The real essence of a college education is not just absorption of knowledge and information but learning a way of thinking that involves actively responding to the ideas of others. Employers seek graduates who have learned how to think critically about situations and ideas, to solve new problems, and to apply traditional knowledge in new circumstances. And these characteristics come from active participation in the learning process.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Differences from High School</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_s01_p01">To understand why interaction is so important in college, let’s look again at some of the typical differences between high school and college instructors:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch07_s00_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Many college classes focus more on how one thinks about a subject than on information about the subject.</strong> While instructors in some large lecture classes may still present information to students, as you take more classes in your major and other smaller classes, you’ll find that simply giving back facts or information on tests or in assigned papers means much less. You really are expected to develop your own ideas and communicate them well. Doing that successfully usually requires talking with others, testing out your thoughts against those of others, responding to instructors’ questions, and other interactions.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Instructors are usually very actively involved in their fields.</strong> While high school teachers often are most interested in <em class="emphasis">teaching</em>, college instructors are often more interested in their own fields. They may be passionate about their subject and want you to be as well. They can become excited when a student asks a question that shows some deeper understanding of something in the field.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">College instructors give</strong> <em class="emphasis bolditalic">you</em> <strong class="emphasis bold">the responsibility for learning.</strong> Many high school teachers monitor their students’ progress and reach out if they see a student not doing well. In college, however, students are considered adults in charge of their own learning. Miss some classes, turn in a paper late, do poorly on an exam—and you will get a low grade, but the instructor likely won’t come looking for you to offer help. But if <em class="emphasis">you</em> ask questions when you don’t understand and actively seek out your instructor during office hours to more fully discuss your ideas for a paper, then the instructor will likely give you the help you need.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Academic freedom is very important in college.</strong> High school instructors generally are given a set curriculum and have little freedom to choose what—or how—to teach. College instructors have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">academic freedom</a><span class="glossdef">The concept present in almost all colleges that instructors are free, within the boundaries of laws and ethics, to pursue studies and to teach topics they deem appropriate within their field, without interference from administrators, officials, or others.</span></span>, however, allowing them to teach controversial topics and express their own ideas—and they may expect you to partake in this freedom as well. They have more respect for students who engage in the subject and demonstrate their thinking skills through participation in the class.</li>
