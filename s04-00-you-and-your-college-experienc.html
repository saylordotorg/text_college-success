    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Welcome to College!</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p01">Congratulations on your decision to attend college! For the great majority of college students, it really was your <em class="emphasis">decision</em>—not just an automatic thing to do. If you happen to be one of the few who just sort of ended up in college for want of anything better to do, the benefits of college will soon become obvious.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p02">The reason for this book, and for almost all college courses, is that college does require commitment and effort. Like everything else in life that leads to meaningful results, success in college is not automatic. But when you apply yourself to your studies using the skills you’ll learn in this book, you’ll find you can succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p03">When asked, most students say they’re in college primarily for the job or career they expect to follow after college. And they are correct that college pays off enormously in terms of future earnings, job security and stability, and job satisfaction. Every statistic shows that people with a college education will make much more in their lifetime (much, much more than the cost of college itself) and be much happier with the work they do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p04">But job and career issues are only a part of the big picture. A college education results in many other personal benefits, and these also should be part of your motivation for doing well and continuing with your college plans. Here are a few additional, less tangible benefits of a college education:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_l01">
            <li>You will have a fuller life and a better understanding of the world around you.</li>
            <li>You will gain decision-making and problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>You will meet many interesting and diverse people and have a richer social life.</li>
            <li>You will gain self-confidence.</li>
            <li>You will gain learning skills that can continue for a lifetime.</li>
            <li>You will make wiser decisions about lifestyle issues and live healthier.</li>
            <li>You will make wiser economic decisions the rest of your life.</li>
            <li>You will be better equipped to deal with other people, organizations, governmental agencies, and all the hassles of daily life.</li>
            <li>You will feel more fully a part of your community, the larger culture, and history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p05">A college education is correlated with greater success in all those areas, even though most students are usually more concerned with making it through the next class or test than the rest of their lives. But sometimes it helps to recall what a truly great step forward you are taking!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p06">Sadly, however, it’s important to recognize that some students do not succeed in college and drop out within the first year. Sometimes it’s due to an unsolvable financial problem or a personal or family crisis, but most of the time students drop out because they’re having problems passing their courses. The two biggest causes of this problem are a lack of motivation and not having learned the skills needed to succeed in college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p07">A book like this one can help you stay motivated when things get tough, but it can’t necessarily <em class="emphasis">give</em> you motivation to start with. That’s part of what you yourself have to bring to college. What we can promise you is that you can learn the skills for succeeding in college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p08">Special skills are needed because college isn’t the same as high school. Throughout this book, we’ll be looking at the many ways college is different from high school. To name just a few, college is different in study skills needed, in personal skills related to being independent, in social skills for getting along with instructors and others on campus, in financial realities, in matters of personal health, and more.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p09">Remember, you can learn whatever you need in order to succeed. That’s what this book is all about. You’ll learn how to get the most out of going to class. You’ll learn how to study in ways that use your time efficiently and help you pass tests. You’ll even learn how to remember what you read in your college textbooks. You’ll learn how to manage your time more effectively than you might have in the past, so that studying is less a burden and more a simple routine. You’ll even learn how things like eating well and getting enough sleep and exercise make it easier to do well in your classes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p10">One warning: you might not at first see an immediate payoff for everything you read in this book. When it comes to certain things, such as tips for how to take good notes in class to help you study later on for a test, you will get specific, practical advice you can put to use immediately to get a better grade. But not everything is as obvious or immediately beneficial. Some of the things you’ll read about here involve ideas you’ll need to think about. Some things will help you get to know yourself better and understand more clearly what you really want from your education and how to go about attaining them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s00_p11">But we promise you this: if you care enough to want to succeed in college and care enough to read these chapters and try to use the information, suggestions, and tips presented here, you <em class="emphasis">will</em> succeed in college.</p>
