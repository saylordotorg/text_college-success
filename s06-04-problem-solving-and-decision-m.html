    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_p01">Much of your college and professional life will be spent solving problems; some will be complex, such as deciding on a career, and require time and effort to come up with a solution. Others will be small, such as deciding what to eat for lunch, and will allow you to make a quick decision based entirely on your own experience. But, in either case, when coming up with the solution and deciding what to do, follow the same basic steps.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Define the problem.</strong> Use your analytical skills. What is the real issue? Why is it a problem? What are the root causes? What kinds of outcomes or actions do you expect to generate to solve the problem? What are some of the key characteristics that will make a good choice: Timing? Resources? Availability of tools and materials? For more complex problems, it helps to actually write out the problem and the answers to these questions. Can you clarify your understanding of the problem by using metaphors to illustrate the issue?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Narrow the problem.</strong> Many problems are made up of a series of smaller problems, each requiring its own solution. Can you break the problem into different facets? What aspects of the current issue are “noise” that should not be considered in the problem solution? (Use critical thinking to separate facts from opinion in this step.)</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Generate possible solutions.</strong> List all your options. Use your creative thinking skills in this phase. Did you come up with the second “right” answer, and the third or the fourth? Can any of these answers be combined into a stronger solution? What past or existing solutions can be adapted or combined to solve this problem?</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 class="title">Group Think: Effective Brainstorming</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Brainstorming</a><span class="glossdef">A process of generating ideas for solutions in a group of people.</span></span> is a process of generating ideas for solutions in a group. This method is very effective because ideas from one person will trigger additional ideas from another. The following guidelines make for an effective brainstorming session:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l03">
            <li>Decide who should moderate the session. That person may participate, but his main role is to keep the discussion flowing.</li>
            <li>Define the problem to be discussed and the time you will allow to consider it.</li>
            <li>Write all ideas down on a board or flip chart for all participants to see.</li>
            <li>Encourage everyone to speak.</li>
            <li>Do not allow criticism of ideas. <em class="emphasis">All</em> ideas are good during a brainstorm. Suspend disbelief until after the session. Remember a wildly impossible idea may trigger a creative and feasible solution to a problem.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_l04">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose the best solution.</strong> Use your critical thinking skills to select the most likely choices. List the pros and cons for each of your selections. How do these lists compare with the requirements you identified when you defined the problem? If you still can’t decide between options, you may want to seek further input from your brainstorming team.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Decisions, Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p01">You will be called on to make many decisions in your life. Some will be personal, like what to major in, or whether or not to get married. Other times you will be making decisions on behalf of others at work or for a volunteer organization. Occasionally you will be asked for your opinion or experience for decisions others are making. To be effective in all of these circumstances, it is helpful to understand some principles about decision making.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p02">First, define who is responsible for solving the problem or making the decision. In an organization, this may be someone above or below you on the organization chart but is usually the person who will be responsible for implementing the solution. Deciding on an academic major should be your decision, because <em class="emphasis">you</em> will have to follow the course of study. Deciding on the boundaries of a sales territory would most likely be the sales manager who supervises the territories, because he or she will be responsible for producing the results with the combined territories. Once you define who is responsible for making the decision, everyone else will fall into one of two roles: giving input, or in rare cases, approving the decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p03">Understanding the role of input is very important for good decisions. Input is sought or given due to experience or expertise, but it is up to the decision maker to weigh the input and decide whether and how to use it. Input should be fact based, or if offering an opinion, it should be clearly stated as such. Finally, once input is given, the person giving the input must support the other’s decision, whether or not the input is actually used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Consider a team working on a project for a science course. The team assigns you the responsibility of analyzing and presenting a large set of complex data. Others on the team will set up the experiment to demonstrate the hypothesis, prepare the class presentation, and write the paper summarizing the results. As you face the data, you go to the team to seek input about the level of detail on the data you should consider for your analysis. The person doing the experiment setup thinks you should be very detailed, because then it will be easy to compare experiment results with the data. However, the person preparing the class presentation wants only high-level data to be considered because that will make for a clearer presentation. If there is not a clear understanding of the decision-making process, each of you may think the decision is yours to make because it influences the output of your work; there will be conflict and frustration on the team. If the decision maker is clearly defined upfront, however, and the input is thoughtfully given and considered, a good decision can be made (perhaps a creative compromise?) and the team can get behind the decision and work together to complete the project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch03_s04_s01_p05">Finally, there is the approval role in decisions. This is very common in business decisions but often occurs in college work as well (the professor needs to approve the theme of the team project, for example). Approval decisions are usually based on availability of resources, legality, history, or policy.</p>
