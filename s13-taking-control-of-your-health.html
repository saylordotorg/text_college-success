        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p01">Health and wellness are important for everyone—students included. Not only will you do better in school when your health is good, but you’ll be happier as a person. And the habits you develop now will likely persist for years to come. That means that what you’re doing now in terms of personal health will have a huge influence on your health throughout life and can help you avoid many serious diseases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p02">Considerable research has demonstrated that the basic elements of good health—nutrition, exercise, not abusing substances, stress reduction—are important for preventing disease. You’ll live much longer and happier than someone without good habits. Here are a few of the health problems whose risks can be lowered by healthful habits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_l01">
            <li>Cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and strokes (the numbers one and three causes of death)</li>
            <li>Some cancers</li>
            <li>Diabetes (currently reaching epidemic proportions)</li>
            <li>Lung diseases related to smoking</li>
            <li>Injuries related to substance abuse</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p03">Wellness is more than just avoiding disease. Wellness involves feeling good in every respect, in mind and spirit as well as in body. Good health habits also offer these benefits for your college career:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_l02">
            <li>More energy</li>
            <li>Better ability to focus on your studies</li>
            <li>Less stress, feeling more resilient and able to handle day-to-day stress</li>
            <li>Less time lost to colds, flu, infections, and other illnesses</li>
            <li>More restful sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p04">This chapter examines a wide range of topics, from nutrition, exercise, and sleep to substance abuse and risks related to sexual activity. All of these involve personal attitudes and behaviors. And they are all linked together to one of the biggest problems students face: stress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s00_p05">Everyone knows about stress, but not everyone knows how to control it. Stress is the great enemy of college success. But once you’ve learned how to reduce it where you can and cope with unavoidable stress, you’ll be well on the road to becoming the best student you can be.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_p01">Most Americans have a real problem with food. Overeating causes health problems, but what and how you eat can also affect how well you do as a student.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Are So Many Americans Overweight?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Americans are eating too much—much more so than in the past. One-third of all Americans twenty years or older are obese. Another third of all adults are overweight. That means that two-thirds of us are not eating well or getting enough exercise for how we eat. There are many intertwined causes of this problem in American culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p02">Why are being <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">overweight</a><span class="glossdef">Having more body fat than is optimally healthy, often defined as a body mass index between 25 and 29.9.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">obesity</a><span class="glossdef">Condition in which body fat has accumulated to the point of having adverse health effects, often defined as a body mass index of 30 or greater.</span></span> a problem? Obesity is associated with many medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Although some health problems may not appear until later in life, diabetes is increasing rapidly in children and teenagers. Worse, the habits young adults may already have or may form during their college years generally continue into later years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p03">But it’s not just about body weight. Good nutrition is still important even if you don’t have a health problem. What you eat affects how you feel and how well you function mentally and physically. Food affects how well you study and how you do on tests. Doughnuts for breakfast can lower your grades!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Students Find It So Tough to Eat Healthily?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s02_p01">If Americans have trouble eating well in an environment that encourages overeating, college students often have it even worse. It seems like food is everywhere, and students are always snacking between classes. Fast food restaurants abound. There may not be time to get back to your dorm or apartment for lunch, and it’s just so easy to grab a quick pastry at the coffee spot as you pass by between classes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s02_p02">It’s the eating by habit, or mindlessly, that usually gets us in trouble. If we’re mindful instead, however, it’s easy to develop better habits. Take the Nutrition Self-Assessment to evaluate your present eating habits.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Much Exercise and What Kind?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_p01">With <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aerobic exercise</a><span class="glossdef">Brisk physical activity that requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body’s increased oxygen needs.</span></span>, your heart and lungs are working hard enough to improve your cardiovascular fitness. This generally means moving fast enough to increase your heart rate and breathing. For health and stress-reducing benefits, try to exercise at least three days a week for at least twenty to thirty minutes at a time. If you really enjoy exercise and are motivated, you may exercise as often as six days a week, but take at least one day of rest. When you’re first starting out, or if you’ve been inactive for a while, take it gradually, and let your body adjust between sessions. But the old expression “No pain, no gain” is not true, regardless of what some past gym teacher may have said! If you feel pain in any activity, stop or cut back. The way to build up strength and endurance is through a plan that is consistent and gradual.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_p02">For exercise to have aerobic benefits, try to keep your heart rate in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">target heart rate</a><span class="glossdef">The level of heartbeat that gives you the best workout: about 60 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate, which is typically calculated as 220 minus your age.</span></span> zone for at least twenty to thirty minutes. The target heart rate is 60 percent to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate, which can be calculated as 220 minus your age. For example, if you are 24 years old, your maximum heart rate is calculated as 196, and your target heart rate is 118 to 166 beats per minute. If you are just starting an exercise program, stay at the lower end of this range and gradually work up over a few weeks. “Additional Resources” below includes an online calculator that estimates your target heart rate depending on your present level of fitness.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Enjoy It!</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p01">Most important, find a type of exercise or activity that you enjoy—or else you won’t stick with it. This can be as simple and easy as a brisk walk or slow jog through a park or across campus. Swimming is excellent exercise, but so is dancing. Think about what you like to do and explore activities that provide exercise while you’re having fun.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p02">Do whatever you need to make your chosen activity enjoyable. Many people listen to music and some even read when using workout equipment. Try different activities to prevent boredom. You also gain by taking the stairs instead of elevators, walking farther across campus instead of parking as close to your destination as you can get, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p03">Exercise with a friend is more enjoyable, including jogging or biking together. Some campuses have installed equipment for students to play Dance Dance Revolution. Many Nintendo Wii games can get your heart rate up.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p04">You may stay more motivated using exercise equipment. An inexpensive pedometer can track your progress walking or jogging, or a bike computer can monitor your speed and time. A heart rate monitor makes it easy to stay in your target zone; many models also calculate calories burned. Some devices can input your exercise into your computer to track your progress and make a chart of your improvements.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s02_s01_p05">The biggest obstacle to getting enough exercise, many students say, is a lack of time. Actually, we all have the time, if we manage it well. Build exercise into your weekly schedule on selected days. Eventually you’ll find that regular exercise actually saves you time because you’re sleeping better and concentrating better. Time you used to fritter away is now used for activity that provides many benefits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Most campuses have resources to make exercise easier and more enjoyable for their students. Take a look around and think about what you might enjoy. A fitness center may offer exercise equipment. There may be regularly scheduled aerobic or spin classes. You don’t have to be an athlete to enjoy casual sports such as playing tennis or shooting hoops with a friend. If you like more organized team sports, try intramural sports.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_p01">You may not realize the benefits of sleep, or the problems associated with being sleep deprived, because most likely you’ve had the same sleep habits for a long time. Or maybe you know you’re getting less sleep now, but with all the changes in your life, how can you tell if some of your stress or problems studying are related to not enough sleep?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s01_p02">On the positive side, a healthy amount of sleep has the following benefits:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p01">College students are the most sleep-deprived population group in the country. With so much to do, who has time for sleep?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep a night, and the average is around eight. Some say they need much less than that, but often their behavior during the day shows they are actually sleep deprived. Some genuinely need only about six hours a night. New research indicates there may be a “sleep gene” that determines how much sleep a person needs. So how much sleep do <em class="emphasis">you</em> actually need?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s02_p03">There is no simple answer, in part because the quality of sleep is just as important as the number of hours a person sleeps. Sleeping fitfully for nine hours and waking during the night is usually worse than seven or eight hours of good sleep, so you can’t simply count the hours. Do you usually feel rested and alert all day long? Do you rise from bed easily in the morning without struggling with the alarm clock? Do you have no trouble paying attention to your instructors and never feel sleepy in a lecture class? Are you not continually driven to drink more coffee or caffeine-heavy “power drinks” to stay attentive? Are you able to get through work without feeling exhausted? If you answered yes to all of these, you likely are in that 10 percent to 15 percent of college students who consistently get enough sleep.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p01">You have to allow yourself enough time for a good night’s sleep. Using the time management strategies discussed in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>, schedule at least eight hours for sleeping every night. If you still don’t feel alert and energetic during the day, try increasing this to nine hours.

Caffeine remains in the body for three to five hours on the average, much longer for some people. Remember that many soft drinks contain caffeine.</li>
                <li>Don’t eat in the two to three hours before bed. Avoid alcohol before bedtime.</li>
                <li>Don’t nap during the day. Napping is the least productive form of rest and often makes you less alert. It may also prevent you from getting a good night’s sleep.</li>
                <li>Exercise earlier in the day (at least several hours before bedtime).</li>
                <li>Try to get to bed and wake about the same time every day—your body likes a routine.</li>
                <li>Make sure the environment is conducive to sleep: dark, quiet, comfortable, and cool.</li>
                <li>Use your bed only for sleeping, not for studying, watching television, or other activities. Going to bed will become associated with going to sleep.</li>
                <li>Establish a presleep winding-down routine, such as taking a hot bath, listening to soothing music, or reading (not a textbook). Try one of the relaxation techniques described in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10_s05#lochhaas-ch10_s05">Section 10.5 "Stress"</a>.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p02">If you can’t fall asleep after ten to fifteen minutes in bed, it’s better to get up and do something else rather than lie there fitfully for hours. Do something you find restful (or boring). Read, or listen to a recorded book. Go back to bed when you’re sleepy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s03_s03_p03">If you frequently cannot get to sleep or are often awake for a long time during the night, you may be suffering from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insomnia</a><span class="glossdef">An inability to sleep; chronic sleeplessness.</span></span>, a medical condition.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p01">Everyone knows smoking is harmful to one’s health. Smoking causes cancer and lung and heart disease. Most adult smokers continue smoking not because they really think it won’t harm them but because it’s very difficult to stop.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p02">If you have never smoked or used smokeless tobacco, feel good about your choices. But read this section anyway because you may have friends now or in the future who smoke, and it’s important to understand this behavior. If you do smoke, even only rarely as a “social smoker,” be honest with yourself—wouldn’t you like to stop if you thought you could without suffering? Simply by being in college now, you’ve shown that you care about your future and your life. You likely care about your health, too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p03">Many young smokers think there is plenty of time to quit later. Social smokers, who may have a cigarette only occasionally with a friend, usually think they won’t develop a habit. But smokers are fooling themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nicotine</a><span class="glossdef">A habit-forming stimulant found in tobacco, which raises blood pressure, increases heart rate, and has toxic effects throughout the body.</span></span> is one of the most addictive drugs in our society today. Admitting this to yourself is the first step toward becoming smoke free.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s01_p04">First, the good news. Stopping smoking brings immediate health benefits, and the benefits get better over time. Just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate drops. After two weeks to three months, your heart attack risk begins to drop and your lung function begins to improve. After one year, your added risk of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coronary heart disease</a><span class="glossdef">A heart disease caused by damage to the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart.</span></span> is half that of a smoker’s. And every year your health continues to improve.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Of all the issues that can affect a student’s health and success in college, drinking causes more problems than anything else. Everyone knows what happens when you drink too much. Your judgment is impaired and you may behave in risky ways. Your health may be affected. Your studies likely are affected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Most college students report drinking at least some alcohol at some time—and even those who do not drink are often affected by others who do. Here are a few facts about alcohol use among college students from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Death.</strong> Each year, 1,700 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related unintentional injuries, and 599,000 students are injured.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Assault.</strong> More than 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sexual abuse.</strong> More than 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Academic problems.</strong> About 25 percent of college students report academic consequences of their drinking, including missing class, falling behind, doing poorly on exams or papers, and receiving lower grades overall.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Health problems.</strong> More than 150,000 students develop an alcohol-related health problem.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Alcohol abuse and dependence.</strong> In the past twelve months, 31 percent of college students met criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse and 6 percent for a diagnosis of alcohol <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dependence</a><span class="glossdef">Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent on something that is psychologically or physically habit forming (especially alcohol or narcotic drugs); addiction.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lochhaas-fn10_003">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, “A Snapshot of Annual High-Risk College Drinking Consequences,” College Drinking—Changing the Culture, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/StatsSummaries/snapshot.aspx">http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/StatsSummaries/snapshot.aspx</a> (accessed July 13, 2010).</span>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p03">So why is drinking so popular if it causes so many problems? You probably already know the answer to that: most college students say they have more fun when drinking. They’re not going to stop drinking just because someone lectures them about it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_p04">Like everything else that affects your health and happiness—eating, exercise, use of other substances—drinking is a matter of personal choice. Like most decisions we all face, there are trade-offs. The most that anyone can reasonably ask of you is to be smart in your decisions. That means understanding the effects of alcohol and deciding to take control.</p>

Say, for example, I have a big test tomorrow, and I’ve been studying for hours, and just when I knock off to relax for a while, a friend stops by with a six-pack of beer. I’d planned to get to bed early, but my friend pops open a beer and sticks it in my hand, saying it will help me relax. So I tell myself just one, or maybe two—after all, that’s not really <em class="emphasis">drinking.</em> And let’s say I stop after two (or three) and get to bed. Maybe I don’t sleep quite as well, but I still pass the test in the morning. So—was that peer pressure or my decision?</p>

He had had a few beers at parties through high school but had never binged and felt there was nothing wrong with that as long as he kept it under control. But he was surprised how much alcohol flowed through the fraternity house, and not just at parties—and the house advisor just seemed to look the other way. He wanted to fit in, so he usually had a few whenever his roommate or others called him away from studying. One night he definitely drank too much. He slept late, missed his first two classes, and felt rotten most of the day. He told himself he’d drink only on weekends and only in moderation. Being underage didn’t bother him, but his grades hadn’t been all that great in high school, and he didn’t want to screw up his first year in college. But it was only one day before some of the older fraternity brothers interrupted his studying again and stuck a beer in his hand. He didn’t know what to do.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_p01">If you think you may be drinking too much, then you probably are. Can you stop—or drink moderately if you are of age—and still have fun with your friends? Of course. Here are some tips for enjoying yourself in social situations when others are drinking:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_l01">
                <li>Drink only moderately (if above legal age) and slowly. Your body processes alcohol at a rate of about one drink an hour—drinking faster than that leads to problems. Sip slowly. Set yourself a limit and stick to it.</li>
                <li>Drink a mixer without the alcohol. It tastes just as good or better. Alternate alcoholic drinks with nonalcoholic ones to slow down the pace.</li>
                <li>Rather than just standing around with others who are drinking, stay active: move about and mingle with different people, dance, and so on.</li>
                <li>If someone tries to make you uncomfortable for not drinking, go talk to someone else.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_p02">Because drinking is a serious issue in many places, it’s a good idea to know what to do if you find yourself with a friend who has had too much to drink:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s02_s04_l02">
                <li>Stay with the person if there is any risk of him hurting himself (driving, biking) or passing out. Take away his keys if necessary.</li>
                <li>If he passes out after drinking a great deal of alcohol fast and cannot be awakened, get medical help.</li>
                <li>An intoxicated person who falls asleep or passes out on his back is at risk of choking on vomit—roll him on his side or face down.</li>
                <li>Do not try to give him food or other substances in an effort to sober him up.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p01">People use drugs for the same reasons people use alcohol. They say they enjoy getting high. They may say a drug helps them relax or unwind, have fun, enjoy the company of others, or escape the pressures of being a student. While alcohol is a legal drug for those above the drinking age, most other drugs—including the use of many <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prescription drugs</a><span class="glossdef">A drug prescribed to a specific person for a specific medical condition by a health-care provider; many prescription drugs are illegal when used by someone other than the person for whom it was prescribed.</span></span> not prescribed for the person taking them—are illegal. They usually involve more serious legal consequences if the user is caught. Some people may feel there’s safety in numbers: if a lot of people are using a drug, or drinking, then how can it be too bad? But other drugs carry the same risks as alcohol for health problems, a risk of death or injury, and a serious impact on your ability to do well as a student.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p02">As with alcohol, the choice is yours. What’s important is to understand what you’re doing and make smart choices. What’s the gain, and what are the risks and costs?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p03">While society may seem to condone drinking, and the laws regarding underage drinking or being drunk in public may not seem too harsh, the legal reality of being caught with an illegal drug can impact the rest of your life. Arrest and conviction may result in being expelled from college—even with a first offense. A conviction is a permanent legal record that can keep you from getting the job you may be going to college for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Although the effects of different drugs vary widely, a single use of a drug can have serious effects and consequences. Even if you’re told that a pill is a prescription medication whose effects are mild or safe, can you really be sure of the exact ingredients and strength of that pill? Do you fully understand how it can affect you with repeated use? Can it be addictive? Could it show up on an unexpected random drug test at work?</p>

                    <li>Excessive drinking or substance abuse is a common—but unhealthy—response to the stresses of college life. While the decisions are yours, it’s important to understand the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs and how they impact your life.</li>
                    <li>Quitting smoking is hard, but it’s clearly worth it—and lots of help is available. If you’re a smoker, make this the year you become proud of yourself for quitting.</li>
                    <li>If you like to drink, be honest with yourself. How much does drinking enrich your life, and how much do the effects of drinking interfere with your life? Make smart decisions so that you live your life to its fullest without regrets about losing control.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding drugs can be a complicated issue, certainly not as simple as simply deciding to say no. But you’ve already made the decision to attend college, and that’s a smart decision. Make smart choices in other areas of your life as well.</li>

Most of our stressors are not physical threats but situations or events like an upcoming test or an emotional break-up.

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Causes Stress?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p01">Not all stressors are bad things. Exciting, positive things also cause a type of stress, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">eustress</a><span class="glossdef">A positive and stimulating kind or level of stress.</span></span>. Falling in love, getting an unexpected sum of money, acing an exam you’d worried about—all of these are positive things that affect the body and mind in ways similar to negative stress: you can’t help thinking about it, you may lose your appetite and lie awake at night, and your routine life may be momentarily disrupted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p02">But the kind of stress that causes most trouble results from negative stressors. Life events that usually cause significant stress include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>Serious illness or injury</li>
            <li>Serious illness, injury, or death of a family member or loved one</li>
            <li>Losing a job or sudden financial catastrophe</li>
            <li>Unwanted pregnancy</li>
            <li>Divorce or ending a long-term relationship (including parents’ divorce)</li>
            <li>Being arrested or convicted of a crime</li>
            <li>Being put on academic probation or suspended</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p03">Life events like these usually cause a lot of stress that may begin suddenly and disrupt one’s life in many ways. Fortunately, these stressors do not occur every day and eventually end—though they can be very severe and disruptive when experienced. Some major life stresses, such as having a parent or family member with a serious illness, can last a long time and may require professional help to cope with them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p04">Everyday kinds of stressors are far more common but can add up and produce as much stress as a major life event:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_l02">
            <li>Anxiety about not having enough time for classes, job, studies, and social life</li>
            <li>Worries about grades, an upcoming test, or an assignment</li>
            <li>Money concerns</li>
            <li>Conflict with a roommate, someone at work, or family member</li>
            <li>Anxiety or doubts about one’s future or difficulty choosing a major or career</li>
            <li>Frequent colds, allergy attacks, other continuing health issues</li>
            <li>Concerns about one’s appearance, weight, eating habits, and so on.</li>
            <li>Relationship tensions, poor social life, loneliness</li>
            <li>Time-consuming hassles such as a broken-down car or the need to find a new apartment</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
            <li>_______________________________________</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p05">Take a moment and reflect on the list above. How many of these stressors have you experienced in the last month? The last year? Circle all the ones that you have experienced. Now go back to your Stress Self-Assessment and look at what you wrote there for causes of your stress. Write any additional things that cause you stress on the blank lines above.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p06">How many stressors have you circled and written in? There is no magic number of stressors that an “average” or “normal” college student experiences—because everyone is unique. In addition, stressors come and go: the stress caused by a midterm exam tomorrow morning may be gone by noon, replaced by feeling good about how you did. Still, most college students are likely to circle about half the items on this list.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s01_p07">But it’s not the <em class="emphasis">number</em> of stressors that counts. You might have circled only one item on that list—but it could produce so much stress for you that you’re just as stressed out as someone else who circled all of them. The point of this exercise is to start by understanding what causes your own stress as a base for learning what to do about it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What’s Wrong with Stress?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p01">Physically, stress prepares us for action: the classic “fight-or-flight” reaction when confronted with a danger. Our heart is pumping fast, and we’re breathing faster to supply the muscles with energy to fight or flee. Many physical effects in the body prepare us for whatever actions we may need to take to survive a threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p02">But what about nonphysical stressors, like worrying about grades? Are there any positive effects there? Imagine what life would feel like if you never had worries, never felt any stress at all. If you never worried about grades or doing well on a test, how much studying would you do for it? If you never thought at all about money, would you make any effort to save it or make it? Obviously, stress can be a good thing when it motivates us to do something, whether it’s study, work, resolving a conflict with another, and so on. So it’s not stress itself that’s negative—it’s <em class="emphasis">unresolved or persistent stress</em> that starts to have unhealthy effects. Chronic (long-term) stress is associated with many physical changes and illnesses, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>Weakened <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">immune system</a><span class="glossdef">The body system, involving many different organs and body tissues, responsible for defending the body against infection and disease.</span></span>, making you more likely to catch a cold and to suffer from any illness longer</li>
            <li>More frequent digestive system problems, including constipation or diarrhea, ulcers, and indigestion</li>
            <li>Elevated <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blood pressure</a><span class="glossdef">The pressure blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels, resulting from complex processes in the body; high blood pressure is associated with several diseases and health problems.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Increased risk of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diabetes</a><span class="glossdef">A disease in which the body has high levels of sugar in the blood because of an inability to manage blood glucose; diabetes is associated with a range of serious health problems.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Muscle and back pain</li>
            <li>More frequent headaches, fatigue, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insomnia</a><span class="glossdef">An inability to sleep; chronic sleeplessness.</span></span>
</li>
            <li>Greater risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular problems over the long term</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p03">Chronic or acute (intense short-term) stress also affects our minds and emotions in many ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_l02">
            <li>Difficulty thinking clearly or concentrating</li>
            <li>Poor memory</li>
            <li>More frequent negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, frustration, powerlessness, resentment, or nervousness—and a general negative outlook on life</li>
            <li>Greater difficulty dealing with others because of irritability, anger, or avoidance</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s02_p04">No wonder we view stress as such a negative thing! As much as we’d like to eliminate all stressors,however, it just can’t happen. Too many things in the real world cause stress and always will.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p01">Since many stressors are unavoidable, the question is what to do about the resulting stress.

Items 1 to 10 are generally not effective ways of dealing with stress, while items 11 to 15 usually are. If you final score is over 20, you’re probably like most beginning college students—feeling a lot of stress and not yet sure how best to deal with it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p08">What’s wrong with those stress-reduction behaviors listed first? Why not watch television or get a lot of sleep when you’re feeling stressed, if that makes you feel better? While it may feel better temporarily to escape feelings of stress in those ways, ultimately they may cause more stress themselves. If you’re worried about grades and being too busy to study as much as you need to, then letting an hour or two slip by watching television will make you even more worried later because then you have even less time. Eating too much may make you sluggish and less able to focus, and if you’re trying to lose weight, you’ll now feel just that much more stressed by what you’ve done. Alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and drugs all generally increase one’s stress over time. Complaining to friends? Over time, your friends will tire of hearing it or tire of arguing with you because a complaining person isn’t much fun to be around. So eventually you may find yourself even more alone and stressed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s03_p09">Yet there is a bright side: there are lots of very positive ways to cope with stress that will also improve your health, make it easier to concentrate on your studies, and make you a happier person overall.</p>

For each, consider whether it is external (like bad job hours or not having enough money) or internal, originating in your attitudes and thoughts. Mark each item with an E (external) or an I (internal).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p02">You may be able to eliminate many external stressors. Talk to your boss about changing your work hours. If you have money problems, work on a budget you can live with (see <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a>), look for a new job, or reduce your expenses by finding a cheaper apartment, selling your car, and using public transportation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p03">What about other external stressors? Taking so many classes that you don’t have the time to study for all of them? Keep working on your time management skills (<a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>). Schedule your days carefully and stick to the schedule. Take fewer classes next term if necessary. What else can you do to eliminate external stressors? Change apartments, get a new roommate, find better child care—consider all your options. And don’t hesitate to talk things over with a college counselor, who may offer other solutions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p04">Internal stressors, however, are often not easily resolved. We can’t make all stressors go away, but we can learn how to cope so that we don’t feel so stressed out most of the time. We can take control of our lives. We can find healthy coping strategies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_p05">All the topics in this chapter involve stress one way or another. Many of the healthy habits that contribute to our wellness and happiness also reduce stress and minimize its effects.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Get Some Exercise</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s01_p01">Exercise, especially <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aerobic exercise</a><span class="glossdef">Brisk physical activity that requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body’s increased oxygen needs.</span></span>, is a great way to help reduce stress. Exercise increases the production of certain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hormones</a><span class="glossdef">A substance produced in the body that has physical, mental, or emotional effects.</span></span>, which leads to a better mood and helps counter depression and anxiety. Exercise helps you feel more energetic and focused so that you are more productive in your work and studies and thus less likely to feel stressed. Regular exercise also helps you sleep better, which further reduces stress.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Get More Sleep</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s02_p01">When sleep deprived, you feel more stress and are less able to concentrate on your work or studies. Many people drink more coffee or other caffeinated beverages when feeling sleepy, and caffeine contributes further to stress-related emotions such as anxiety and nervousness.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s03_p01">Worrying about money is one of the leading causes of stress. Try the financial management skills in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a> to reduce this stress.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Adjust Your Attitude</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p01">You know the saying about the optimist who sees the glass as half full and the pessimist who sees the same glass as half empty. Guess which one feels more stress?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p02">Much of the stress you feel may be rooted in your attitudes toward school, your work—your whole life. If you don’t feel good about these things, how do you change? To begin with, you really need to think about yourself. What makes you happy? Are you expecting your college career to be perfect and always exciting, with never a dull class or reading assignment? Or can you be happy that you are in fact succeeding in college and foresee a great life and career ahead?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p03">Maybe you just need to take a fun elective course to balance that “serious” course that you’re not enjoying so much. Maybe you just need to play an intramural sport to feel as good as you did playing in high school. Maybe you just need to take a brisk walk every morning to feel more alert and stimulated. Maybe listening to some great music on the way to work will brighten your day. Maybe calling up a friend to study together for that big test will make studying more fun.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s04_p04">No one answer works for everyone—you have to look at your life, be honest with yourself about what affects your daily attitude, and then look for ways to make changes. The good news is that although old negative habits can be hard to break, once you’ve turned positive changes into new habits, they will last into a brighter future.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Learn a Relaxation Technique</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s05_p01">Different <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relaxation techniques</a><span class="glossdef">Any specific physical or mental practice developed to help a person calm the mind, relax the body, or both to lower stress and promote rest or concentration.</span></span> can be used to help minimize stress. Following are a few tried-and-tested ways to relax when stress seems overwhelming. You can learn most of these through books, online exercises, CDs or MP3s, and DVDs available at your library or student health center. Practicing one of them can have dramatic effects.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s05_s04_s05_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Deep breathing.</strong> Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight. Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Exhale slowly and smoothly through your mouth. Concentrate on your breathing and feel your chest expanding and relaxing. After five to ten minutes, you will feel more relaxed and focused.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Progressive muscle relaxation.</strong> With this technique, you slowly tense and then relax the body’s major muscle groups. The sensations and mental concentration produce a calming state.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meditation.</strong> Taking many forms, meditation may involve focusing on your breathing, a specific visual image, or a certain thought, while clearing the mind of negative energy. Many podcasts are available to help you find a form of meditation that works best for you.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Yoga or tai chi.</strong> Yoga, tai chi, and other exercises that focus on body position and slow, gradual movements are popular techniques for relaxation and stress reduction. You can learn these techniques through a class or from a DVD.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Music and relaxation CDs and MP3s.</strong> Many different relaxation techniques have been developed for audio training. Simply play the recording and relax as you are guided through the techniques.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Massage.</strong> Regular massages are a way to relax both body and mind. If you can’t afford a weekly massage but enjoy its effects, a local massage therapy school may offer more affordable massage from students and beginning practitioners.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_p01">When is an emotion problematic? Is it bad to feel anxious about a big test coming up or to feel sad after breaking up a romantic relationship?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_p02">It is normal to experience negative emotions. College students face so many demands and stressful situations that many naturally report often feeling anxious, depressed, or lonely. These emotions become problematic only when they persist and begin to affect your life in negative ways. That’s when it’s time to work on your emotional health—just as you’d work on your physical health when illness strikes.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Anxiety</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Anxiety</a><span class="glossdef">Feelings of worry, tension, and nervousness with or without a specific focus of concern; severe or persistent anxiety can be a mental disorder.</span></span> is one of the most common emotions college students experience, often as a result of the demands of college, work, and family and friends. It’s difficult to juggle everything, and you may end up feeling not in control, stressed, and anxious.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p02">Anxiety typically results from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stress</a><span class="glossdef">A natural response of the body and mind to a demand or challenge, often associated with feelings of tension and negative emotions.</span></span>. Some anxiety is often a good thing if it leads to studying for a test, focusing on a problem that needs to be resolved, better management your time and money, and so on. But if anxiety disrupts your focus and makes you freeze up rather than take action, then it may become problematic. Using stress-reduction techniques often helps reduce anxiety to a manageable level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p03">Anxiety is easier to deal with when you know its cause. Then you can take steps to gain control over the part of your life causing the anxiety. But anxiety can become excessive and lead to a dread of everyday situations. There are five types of more serious anxiety:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> is characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry and tension, even when there is little or nothing to provoke it. The person may have physical symptoms, especially fatigue, headaches, muscle tension, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, trembling, twitching, irritability, sweating, and hot flashes.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong> is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions), repetitive behaviors (compulsions), or both. Repetitive behaviors such as hand washing, counting, checking, or cleaning are often performed with the hope of preventing obsessive thoughts or making them go away.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Panic disorder</strong> is characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social phobia (or social anxiety disorder)</strong> is a persistent, intense, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and being embarrassed or humiliated by one’s own actions. Their fear may be so severe that it interferes with work or school, and other ordinary activities. Physical symptoms often accompany the intense anxiety of social phobia and include blushing, profuse sweating, trembling, nausea, and difficulty talking.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s01_p04">These five types of anxiety go beyond the normal anxiety everyone feels at some times. If you feel your anxiety is like any of these, see your health-care provider. Effective treatments are available to help you regain control.</p>

        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Loneliness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Loneliness</a><span class="glossdef">An emotional state of sadness and feeling isolated from or not connected to others.</span></span> is a normal feeling that most people experience at some time. College students away from home for the first time are likely to feel lonely at first. Older students may also feel lonely if they no longer see their old friends. Loneliness involves not feeling connected with others. One person may need only one friend to not feel lonely; others need to feel more connected with a group. There’s no set pattern for feeling lonely.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p02">If you are feeling lonely, there are many things you can do to meet others and feel connected. Don’t sit alone in your room bemoaning the absence of friends. That will only cause more stress and emotional distress. You will likely start making new friends through going to classes, working, studying, and living in the community. But you can jump-start that process by taking active steps such as these:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Realize you don’t have to be physically with friends in order to stay connected. Many students use social Web sites to stay connected with friends at other colleges or in other locations. Telephone calls, instant messaging, and e-mail work for many.</li>
                <li>Understand that you’re not alone in feeling lonely. Many others like you are just waiting for the opportunity to connect, and you will meet them and form new friendships fast once you start reaching out.</li>
                <li>Become involved in campus opportunities to meet others. Every college has a wide range of clubs for students with different interests. If you’re not the “joiner” type, look for individuals in your classes with whom you think you may have something in common and ask them if they’d like to study for a test together or work together on a class project.</li>
                <li>Remember that loneliness is a temporary thing—it’s only a matter of time until you make new friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s02_p03">If your loneliness persists and you seem unable to make friends, then it’s a good idea to talk with your counselor or someone at the student health center. They can help.</p>

                <li>Experiencing problems in a relationship, friendship, or work situation</li>
                <li>Feeling overweight, unhealthy, or not in control of oneself</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_p02">Depression, like stress, can lead to unhealthy consequences such as poor sleep, overeating or loss of appetite, substance abuse, relationship problems, or withdrawal from activities that formerly brought joy. For most people, depression is a temporary state. But severe depression can have crippling effects. Not everyone experiences the same symptoms, but the following are most common:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_l02">

                <li>Irritability or restlessness</li>
                <li>Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable, including sex</li>
                <li>Fatigue and decreased energy</li>
                <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions</li>
                <li>Insomnia, early morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping</li>
                <li>Overeating or appetite loss</li>
                <li>Thoughts of suicide or suicide attempts</li>
                <li>Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s03_p03">If you have feelings like this that last for weeks at a time and affect your daily life, your depression is more severe than “normal,” temporary depression.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p01">Severe depression often makes a person feel there is no hope—and therefore many people with depression do not seek help. In reality, depression can be successfully treated, but only if the person seeks help.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p02">Suicidal feelings, which can result from severe depression, are more common in college students than in the past. Suicide is now the second leading cause of death in American college students (after accidents). In most cases, the person had severe depression and was not receiving treatment. Recognizing severe depression and seeking treatment is crucial.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s01_s04_p03">Depression can strike almost anyone at any age at any kind of college. It is a myth that high-pressure colleges have higher suicide rates or that students who feel compelled to excel because of college pressures are more likely to commit suicide. In reality, anyone can be ill with severe depression and, if not treated, become suicidal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_p01">Emotional balance is an essential element of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wellness</a><span class="glossdef">A state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease.</span></span>—and for succeeding in college. Emotional balance doesn’t mean that you never experience a negative emotion, because these emotions are usually natural and normal. Emotional balance means we balance the negative with the positive, that we can be generally happy even if we’re saddened by some things.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s02_p02">Emotional balance starts with being aware of our emotions and understanding them. If you’re feeling angry, stop and think about the real cause of your anger. Are you really angry because your friend said something about one of your bad habits, or are you angry because you haven’t been able to break that habit? Are you feeling anxiety because you’re worried you might not be cut out for college, or are you just anxious about that test tomorrow?</p>

                <li>Accept that most emotions can’t be directly controlled. But the things you do—such as getting exercise, using a relaxation technique, trying the various stress-reduction methods discussed in this chapter—do improve your emotional state.</li>
                <li>Connect with others. Your emotional state is less likely to change when you keep to yourself and “stew over” the feeling.</li>
                <li>Develop your empathy for others. Empathy involves recognizing the emotions that others are feeling. You’ll find yourself in better emotional balance as a result, and your relationships will improve.</li>
                <li>Be honest in your relationships. If you try to hide your feelings, the other person will know something is wrong and may react the wrong way.</li>
                <li>Understand that negative emotions are temporary. You may be feeling bad now, but it will pass in time. But if a negative feeling does last a long time, recognize that you likely need help resolving it—and that help is available.</li>
                <li>If you’ve just become a college student, know that the first term is usually the hardest. Hang in there. Once you’ve developed effective study habits and time management skills, each term will be easier and happier than the one before.</li>

                <li>Both partners should respect each other as individuals with unique interests and personality traits. Don’t expect your partner to be just like you; embrace rather than reject differences. Both partners should be supportive of each other.</li>
                <li>Both partners should trust each other and be honest with each other. You must feel that you can open up emotionally to the other without fear of rejection. Starting out with deceptions is certain to cause eventual problems.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p01">In any friendship or relationship, conflict will eventually happen. This is just natural because people are different. If a conflict is ignored, or the partners just argue without resolving it, it may simmer and continue to cause tension, eventually weakening the relationship. It’s better to take steps to resolve it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conflict resolution</a><span class="glossdef">A step-by-step process designed to resolve a dispute or disagreement.</span></span> is a process of understanding what’s really going on and then finding a solution. The same general steps of conflict resolution can work to solve a relationship conflict or a conflict between any people or groups because of a disagreement about anything. Following are the general principles of conflict resolution:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Allow things to cool off.</strong> It’s difficult to resolve a conflict while either party is still emotional. Wait a few minutes or agree to talk about it later.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Using “I statements” rather than “you statements,” each party explains what bothers him or her about the cause of the conflict.</strong> For example, don’t say, “You’re always playing loud music when I’m trying to study.” Instead, say, “I have difficulty studying when you play loud music, and that makes me frustrated and irritable.” “You statements” put the other person on the defensive and evoke emotions that make resolution more difficult.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Listen carefully to what the other person says.</strong> Then restate the message in your own words to give the other a chance to clarify their thoughts and feelings. Each party should listen to the other and restate the other’s message to ensure the real issue is out on the table for discussion.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Accept responsibility for your role in the conflict, instead of blaming the other.</strong> A good example of accepting responsibility is to say, “I know I’m always studying and need the quiet. I guess that makes it hard for you to listen to your music.”</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Brainstorm together to find a solution that satisfies both of you.</strong> Some compromise is usually needed, but that is usually not difficult to reach when you’re calm and are working together on a solution. In this example, you might compromise by going elsewhere to study at selected times when the other has friends over and wants to listen to music, and the other may compromise by agreeing to use headphones at other times and never to play music aloud after 10 p.m.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Apologize, thank, and forgive.</strong> After reaching a resolution, emotional closure is needed to restore your relationship and end on a positive, affirming note. When appropriate, apologize for your past anger or arguing. Thank the other for being willing to compromise to resolve the conflict. In your mind, forgive the person for past misunderstandings and actions so that you do not carry any grudge into the future.</li>

It’s important, if you’re making an effort to stay together, for both partners to accept that being apart will add new pressures on the relationship. Accept also that both of you will be changing in many ways. You may naturally grow apart and decide to break up.</p>
                <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_p04">Yet often long-distance relationships do survive successfully. If you do decide to work to keep your relationship alive and vibrant, there are things you can do:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s06_s03_s02_l02">
                    <li>Acknowledge that you are both changing, and accept and celebrate your new lives.</li>
                    <li>Don’t feel guilty about being excited by your new life, and don’t try to pretend to your partner that you’re always miserable because you’re separated.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be upset or jealous when your partner tells you about new friends and activities—be happy that he or she seems happy. Talk about these changes and be happy for each other.</li>
                    <li>If your relationship is solid, it is already based on trust and mutual support, which should continue to give you strength when apart.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sexual Values and Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p01">It’s often difficult to talk about sexuality and sex. Not only is it a very private matter for most people, but the words themselves are often used loosely, resulting in misunderstandings. Surveys have shown, for example, that about three-fourths of college students say they are “sexually active”—but survey questions rarely specify exactly what that phrase means. To some, sexual activity includes passionate kissing and fondling, while to others the phrase means sexual intercourse. Manual and oral sexual stimulation may or may not be included in an individual’s own definition of being sexually active.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p02">We should therefore begin by defining these terms. First, sexuality is not the same as sex. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Human sexuality</a><span class="glossdef">A general term for how people experience and express themselves as sexual beings, including feelings, thoughts, and actions.</span></span> is a general term for how people experience and express themselves as sexual beings. Since all people are sexual beings, everyone has a dimension of human sexuality regardless of their behavior. Someone who practices complete abstinence from sexual behavior still has the human dimension of sexuality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p03">Sexuality involves <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gender identity</a><span class="glossdef">A person’s sense of self in terms of being male or female.</span></span>, or how we see ourselves in terms of maleness and femaleness, as well as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexual orientation</a><span class="glossdef">A sexual preference or choice that determines whether one chooses a member of the same or the opposite sex, or both, for sexual satisfaction.</span></span>, which refers to the gender qualities of those to whom we are attracted. The phrase <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexual activity</a><span class="glossdef">Any behavior involving genital stimulation, including vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse, that carries the risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease.</span></span> is usually used to refer to behaviors between two (or more) people involving the genitals—but the term may also refer to solo practices such as masturbation or to partner activities that are sexually stimulating but may not involve the genitals. For the purposes of this chapter, with its focus on personal health, the term sexual activity refers to any behavior that carries a risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease. This includes vaginal, oral, and anal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intercourse</a><span class="glossdef">An act of physical sexual contact between individuals that involves the genitalia of at least one person, typically with penetration of the vagina, mouth, or anus.</span></span>. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexual intercourse</a><span class="glossdef">As used here, referring to heterosexual intercourse in which the penis penetrates the vagina.</span></span> will be used to refer to vaginal intercourse, which also carries the risk of unwanted pregnancy. We’ll avoid the most confusing term, sex, which in strict biological terms refers to reproduction but is used loosely to refer to many different behaviors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p04">There is a stereotype that sexual activity is very prominent among college students. One survey found that most college students think that <em class="emphasis">other</em> students have had an average of three sexual partners in the past year, yet 80 percent of those answering said that they <em class="emphasis">themselves</em> had zero or one sexual partner. In other words, college students as a whole are not engaging in sexual activity nearly as much as they think they are. Another study revealed that about 20 percent of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old college students had never been sexually active and about half had not been during the preceding month.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p05">In sum, some college students are sexually active and some are not. Misperceptions of what others are doing may lead to unrealistic expectations or feelings. What’s important, however, is to be aware of your own values and to make responsible decisions that protect your sexual health.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_p06">Information and preparation are the focus of this section of the chapter. People who engage in sexual activity in the heat of the moment—often under the influence of alcohol—without having protection and information for making good decisions are at risk for disease, unwanted pregnancy, or abuse.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Alcohol and Sexual Activity</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s01_s01_p01">Almost all college students know the importance of protection against sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy. So why then do these problems occur so often? Part of the answer is that we don’t always do the right thing even when we know it—especially in the heat of the moment, particularly when drinking or using drugs. Some four hundred thousand eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old college students a year engage in unprotected sexual activity after drinking, and one hundred thousand report having been too intoxicated to know if they had consented to the sexual activity.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What’s “Safe Sex”?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_p01">It has been said that <em class="emphasis">no</em> sexual activity is safe because there is always some risk, even if very small, of protections failing. The phrase “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">safer sex</a><span class="glossdef">The use of protective actions or devices during sexual activity to minimize the risk of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy.</span></span>” better describes actions one can take to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancy.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s01_p01">About two dozen different diseases can be transmitted through sexual activity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Any infection predominantly transmitted through sexual activity between two individuals, usually through direct contact with the genitals or an exchange of body fluids.</span></span> range from infections that can be easily treated with medications to diseases that may have permanent health effects to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)</a><span class="glossdef">Virus transmitted via body fluids during sexual activity and by other means such as drug needle sharing; the cause of AIDS, a fatal disease.</span></span>, the cause of AIDS, a fatal disease. Despite decades of public education campaigns and easy access to protection, STIs still affect many millions of people every year. Often a person feels no symptoms at first and does not realize he or she has the infection and thus passes it on unknowingly. Or a person may not use protection because of simple denial: “It can’t happen to me.”</p>

Although there are some differences, in most cases sexual transmission involves an exchange of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">body fluids</a><span class="glossdef">In general, any fluid within the body, but more specifically used for those fluids that may carry a sexually transmitted disease: blood, semen, and vaginal secretions.</span></span> between two people: semen, vaginal fluids, or blood (or other body fluids containing blood).

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s01_p03">Although many of these diseases may not cause dramatic symptoms, always see a health-care provider if you have the slightest suspicion of having acquired an STI. Not only should you receive treatment as soon as possible to prevent the risk of serious health problems, but you are also obligated to help not pass it on to others.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Know that only <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstinence</a><span class="glossdef">Not engaging in sexual activity.</span></span> is 100 percent safe. Protective devices can fail even when used correctly, although the risk is small. Understand the risks of not always using protection.</li>
                <li>Talk with your partner in advance about your sexual histories and health. Agree that regardless of how sure you both are about not having an STI, you will use protection because you cannot be certain even if you have no symptoms.</li>
                <li>Avoid sexual activity with casual acquaintances whose sexual history you do not know and with whom you have not talked about health issues. Sexual activity is safest with a single partner in a long-term relationship.</li>
                <li>Use a latex condom for all sexual activity. A male condom is about 98 percent effective when used correctly, and a female condom about 95 percent effective when used correctly. With both, incorrect use increases the risk. If you are unsure how to use a condom correctly and safely, do some private online reading. Good information can be found at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/how_to_use_a_condom/article_em.htm">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/how_to_use_a_condom/article_em.htm</a>.

                <li>If you are sexually active with multiple partners, see your health-care provider twice a year for an STI screening even if you are not experiencing symptoms.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Preventing Unwanted Pregnancy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p01">Heterosexual couples who engage in vaginal intercourse are also at risk for an unwanted pregnancy. There are lots of myths about how a woman can’t get pregnant at a certain time in her menstrual cycle or under other conditions, but in fact, there’s a risk of pregnancy after vaginal intercourse at any time. All couples should talk about protection before reaching the stage of having intercourse and take appropriate steps.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p02">While a male condom is about 98 percent effective, that 2 percent failure rate could lead to tens of thousands of unintended pregnancies among college students. When not used correctly, condoms are only 85 percent effective. In addition, a couple that has been healthy and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monogamous</a><span class="glossdef">A relationship involving a single mate for a significant period of time.</span></span> in their relationship for a long time may be less faithful in their use of condoms if the threat of STIs seems diminished. Other methods of birth control should also therefore be considered. With the exception of the male <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vasectomy</a><span class="glossdef">A surgical procedure that causes a man to be sterile and permanently incapable of reproducing unless the procedure is later reversed.</span></span>, at present most other methods are used by the woman. They include intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injected or oral <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contraceptives</a><span class="glossdef">A drug, device, or procedure used for the deliberate prevention of pregnancy.</span></span> (the “pill”), hormone patches, vaginal rings, diaphragms, cervical caps, and sponges. Each has certain advantages and disadvantages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p03">Birth control methods vary widely in effectiveness as well as potential side effects. This is therefore a very personal decision. In addition, two methods can be used together, such as a condom along with a diaphragm or spermicide, which increases the effectiveness. (Note that a male and female condom should not be used together, however, because of the risk of either or both tearing because of friction between them.) Because this is such an important issue, you should talk it over with your health-care provider, or a professional at your student health center or an agency such as Planned Parenthood.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s02_s02_p04">In cases of unprotected vaginal intercourse, or if a condom tears, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emergency contraception</a><span class="glossdef">Contraceptive measures, such as a drug, used to prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse has already occurred.</span></span> is an option for up to five days after intercourse. Sometimes called the “morning after pill” or “plan B,” emergency contraception is an oral hormone that prevents pregnancy from occurring. It is <em class="emphasis">not</em> an “abortion pill.” Planned Parenthood offices around the country can provide more information and confidential contraceptive services including emergency contraception.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sexual Assault and Date Rape</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p01">Sexual assault is a serious problem in America generally and among college students in particular:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_l01">
            <li>About a third of all dating relationships involve some physical violence.</li>
            <li>One in six women and one in ten men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes.</li>
            <li>About a fourth of sexual assault victims are in the typical college age range of eighteen to twenty-four years old.</li>
            <li>As many as one in four women experience unwanted sexual intercourse while attending college.</li>
            <li>In more than three fourths of rape cases, the victim knows the perpetrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sexual assault</a><span class="glossdef">Any form of coerced sexual contact or sexual activity without the other person’s voluntary consent.</span></span> is any form of sexual contact without voluntary consent. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rape</a><span class="glossdef">Unlawful sexual intercourse with or sexual penetration of another person without that person’s consent, typically with force or threat of force.</span></span> is usually more narrowly legally defined as forced sexual intercourse, a specific type of sexual assault. Both are significant problems among college students. Although men can also be victims of sexual assault and rape, the problem usually involves women, so this section focuses primarily on the issue for women in college. Men must also understand what is involved in sexual assault and help build greater awareness of the problem and how to prevent it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p03">Sexual assault is so common in our society in part because many people believe in myths about certain kinds of male-female interaction. Common myths include “It’s not really rape if the woman was flirting first” and “It’s not rape unless the woman is seriously injured.” Both statements are not legally correct. Another myth or source of confusion is the idea that “Saying no is just playing hard to get, not really no.” Men who really believe these myths may not think that they are committing assault, especially if their judgment is impaired by alcohol. Other perpetrators of sexual assault and rape, however, know exactly what they’re doing and in fact may plan to overcome their victim by using alcohol or a date rape drug.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p04">College administrators and educators have worked very hard to promote better awareness of sexual assault and to help students learn how to protect themselves. Yet colleges cannot prevent things that happen at parties and behind closed doors. Students must understand how to protect themselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p05">Perpetrators of sexual assault fall into three categories:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_l02">
            <li>Strangers</li>
            <li>Acquaintances</li>
            <li>Dating partners</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p06">Among college students, assault by a stranger is the least common because campus police departments take many measures to help keep students safe on campus. Nonetheless, use common sense to avoid situations where you might be alone in a vulnerable place. Walk with a friend if you must pass through a quiet place after dark. Don’t open your door to a stranger. Don’t take chances. For more information and ways to reduce your risk of sexual assault, see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-prevention">http://www.rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-prevention</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p07">Most sexual assaults are perpetrated by acquaintances or date partners. Typically, an acquaintance assault begins at a party. Typically, both the man and the woman are drinking—although assault can happen to sober victims as well. The interaction may begin innocently, perhaps with dancing or flirting. The perpetrator may misinterpret the victim’s behavior as a willingness to share sexual activity, or a perpetrator intent on sexual activity may simply pick out a likely target. Either way, the situation may gradually or suddenly change and lead to sexual assault.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p08">Prevention of acquaintance rape begins with the awareness of its likelihood and then taking deliberate steps to ensure you stay safe at and after the party:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_l03">
            <li>Go with a friend and don’t let someone separate you from your friend. Agree to stick together and help each other if it looks like things are getting out of hand. If your friend has too much to drink, don’t leave her or him alone. Plan to leave together and stick to the plan.</li>
            <li>Be especially alert if you become separated from your friend, even if you are only going off alone to look for the bathroom. You may be followed.</li>
            <li>Be cautious if someone is pressuring you to drink heavily.</li>
            <li>Trust your instincts if someone seems to be coming on too aggressively. Get back to your friends.</li>
            <li>Know where you are and have a plan to get home if you have to leave abruptly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p09">These preventions can work well at a party or in other social situations, but they don’t apply to most dating situations when you are alone with another person. About half of sexual assaults on college students are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">date rape</a><span class="glossdef">The rape of a person by someone whom the person is dating.</span></span>. An assault may occur after the first date, when you feel you know the person better and perhaps are not concerned about the risk. This may actually make you more vulnerable, however. Until you really get to know the person well and have a trusting relationship, follow these guidelines to lower the risk of sexual assault:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_l04">
            <li>Make it clear that you have limits on sexual activity. Take care that your body language or appearance does not send a message that you might be “easy.” If there is any question that your date may not understand your limits, talk about your values and limits.</li>
            <li>If your date initiates unwanted sexual activity of any sort, do not resist passively. The other may misinterpret passive behavior as consent.</li>
            <li>Be careful if your date is drinking heavily or using drugs. Avoid drinking yourself, or drink very moderately.</li>
            <li>Stay in public places where there are other people. Do not invite your date to your home before your relationship is well established.</li>
            <li>Trust your instincts if your date seems to be coming on too strong. End the date if necessary.</li>
            <li>Pay attention for signs of an unhealthy relationship (described in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10_s06#lochhaas-ch10_s06">Section 10.6 "Emotional Health and Happiness"</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p10">If you are sexually assaulted, always talk to someone. Call a rape crisis center, your student health center, or the <strong class="emphasis bold">National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE</strong> for a confidential conversation. Even if you do not report the assault to law enforcement, it’s important to talk through your feelings and seek help if needed to prevent an emotional crisis.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Date Rape Drugs</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_p11">In addition to alcohol, sexual predators use certain commonly available drugs to sedate women for sexual assault. They are odorless and tasteless and may be added to a punch bowl or slipped into your drink when you’re not looking. These drugs include the sedatives GHB, sometimes called “liquid ecstasy,” and Rohypnol, also called “roofies.” Both cause sedation in small doses but can have serious medical effects in larger doses. Date rape drugs are typically used at parties. Use the following tips to protect yourself against date rape drugs:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s07_s03_l05">
                <li>Don’t put your drink down where someone else may get to it. If your drink is out of your sight for even a moment, don’t finish it.</li>
                <li>Never accept an open drink. Don’t accept a mixed drink that you did not see mixed from pure ingredients.</li>
                <li>Never drink anything from a punch bowl, even if it’s nonalcoholic. You can’t know what may have been added into the punch.</li>
                <li>If you experience unexpected physical symptoms that may be the result of something you drank or ate, get to an emergency room and ask to be tested.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch10_s08_l01">
            <li>Good health helps you be more successful in college.</li>
            <li>For good nutrition, eat a varied diet with lots of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains and minimize fats, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Regular exercise is not only important for good health but is a great way to reduce stress in your life.</li>
            <li>Sleep is one of the first areas where college students cut back when they find themselves too busy with classes, work, and other activities. Taking the time to get enough sleep, however, makes you so much more efficient when studying that it can actually save you time.</li>
            <li>Substance use and abuse not only takes its toll on the body but also contributes to problems in college, at work, and in the future. You may need to make a smart decision between short-term pleasures and long-term success.</li>
            <li>Since many stressors are unavoidable in life, we all need to find good ways to minimize their effects. The best stress-reducers over time become good habits that will increase our wellness and help us succeed in college and careers.</li>
            <li>If you are having an emotional or relationship problem that persists and affects your life, don’t hesitate to seek help. Most colleges have counselors and health professionals trained to help you get through any crisis.</li>
            <li>Sexual health is your own business—except that sexuality usually affects and is affected by others. Smart choices focus on protecting yourself from potential problems, regardless of your choices about sexual activity.</li>
