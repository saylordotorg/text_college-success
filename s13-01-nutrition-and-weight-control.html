    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Are So Many Americans Overweight?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Americans are eating too much—much more so than in the past. One-third of all Americans twenty years or older are obese. Another third of all adults are overweight. That means that two-thirds of us are not eating well or getting enough exercise for how we eat. There are many intertwined causes of this problem in American culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p02">Why are being <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">overweight</a><span class="glossdef">Having more body fat than is optimally healthy, often defined as a body mass index between 25 and 29.9.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">obesity</a><span class="glossdef">Condition in which body fat has accumulated to the point of having adverse health effects, often defined as a body mass index of 30 or greater.</span></span> a problem? Obesity is associated with many medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Although some health problems may not appear until later in life, diabetes is increasing rapidly in children and teenagers. Worse, the habits young adults may already have or may form during their college years generally continue into later years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s01_p03">But it’s not just about body weight. Good nutrition is still important even if you don’t have a health problem. What you eat affects how you feel and how well you function mentally and physically. Food affects how well you study and how you do on tests. Doughnuts for breakfast can lower your grades!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Students Find It So Tough to Eat Healthily?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s02_p01">If Americans have trouble eating well in an environment that encourages overeating, college students often have it even worse. It seems like food is everywhere, and students are always snacking between classes. Fast food restaurants abound. There may not be time to get back to your dorm or apartment for lunch, and it’s just so easy to grab a quick pastry at the coffee spot as you pass by between classes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch10_s01_s02_p02">It’s the eating by habit, or mindlessly, that usually gets us in trouble. If we’re mindful instead, however, it’s easy to develop better habits. Take the Nutrition Self-Assessment to evaluate your present eating habits.</p>
