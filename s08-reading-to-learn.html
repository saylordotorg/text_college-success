        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading to Learn</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s00_p01">Sure you can read. After all, that’s what you are doing now, at this moment. But reading to learn is active reading, a process that involves much more than the mechanics of converting a set of letters into meaningful words. It is a process that you will use for gathering much of the new information you get in school—and in life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s00_p02">Does the following sound familiar? You’ve had a full day of classes, so you go to the gym to get in a workout. Afterward, you meet a friend who suggests going out for a quick bite; you get back to your room around eight o’clock and settle in to work on your reading assignment, a chapter from your sociology text entitled “Stratification and Social Mobility.” You jump right in to the first paragraph, but the second paragraph seems a bit tougher. Suddenly you wake up and shake your head and see your clock says 11:15 p.m. Oh no! Three hours down the drain napping, and your book is still staring back at you at the beginning of the chapter, and you have a crick in your neck.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s00_p03">Now, picture this: You schedule yourself for a series of shorter reading periods at the library between classes and during the afternoon. You spend a few minutes preparing for what you are going to read, and you get to work with pen and paper in hand. After your scheduled reading periods, by 5:30 p.m. you have completed the assignment, making a note that you are interested in comparing the social mobility in India with that in the United States. You reward yourself with a workout and dinner with a friend. At 8 p.m., you return to your room and review your notes, feeling confident that you are ready for the next class.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s00_p04">The difference between these two scenarios is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active reading</a><span class="glossdef">A conscious process in which the reader chooses to create an interaction with the written word, with the objective of increasing understanding.</span></span>. Active reading is a planned, deliberate set of strategies to engage with text-based materials with the purpose of increasing your understanding. This is a key skill you need to master for college. Along with listening, it is the primary method for absorbing new ideas and information in college. But active reading also applies to and facilitates the other steps of the learning cycle; it is critical for preparing, capturing, and reviewing, too.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_l01">
            <li>Explain how reading in college is different from reading in high school.</li>
            <li>Understand the importance of reading for college learning.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_p01">Think back to a high school history or literature class. Those were probably the classes in which you had the most reading. You would be assigned a chapter, or a few pages in a chapter, with the expectation that you would be discussing the reading assignment in class. In class, the teacher would guide you and your classmates through a review of your reading and ask questions to keep the discussion moving. The teacher usually was a key part of how you learned from your reading.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_p02">If you have been away from school for some time, it’s likely that your reading has been fairly casual. While time spent with a magazine or newspaper can be important, it’s not the sort of concentrated reading you will do in college. And no one will ask you to write in response to a magazine piece you’ve read or quiz you about a newspaper article.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_p03">In college, reading is much different. You will be expected to read much more. For each hour you spend in the classroom, you will be expected to spend two or more additional hours studying between classes, and most of that will be reading. Assignments will be longer (a couple of chapters is common, compared with perhaps only a few pages in high school) and much more difficult. College textbook authors write using many technical terms and include complex ideas. Many college authors include research, and some textbooks are written in a style you may find very dry. You will also have to read from a variety of sources: your textbook, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ancillary materials</a><span class="glossdef">Additional or supplemental reading materials beyond a standard course textbook. These may include journal articles and academic papers.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Documents, letters, diaries, newspaper reports, financial reports, lab reports, and records that directly report or offer new information or ideas, rather than secondary sources (like many textbooks) that collect information that originated in primary sources.</span></span>, academic journals, periodicals, and online postings. Your assignments in literature courses will be complete books, possibly with convoluted plots and unusual wording or dialects, and they may have so many characters you’ll feel like you need a scorecard to keep them straight.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_p04">In college, most instructors do not spend much time reviewing the reading assignment in class. Rather, they expect that you have done the assignment before coming to class and understand the material. The class lecture or discussion is often based on that expectation. Tests, too, are based on that expectation. This is why active reading is so important—it’s up to you to do the reading and comprehend what you read.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Note:</strong> It may not always be clear on an instructor’s syllabus, but a reading assignment listed on any given class date should be read <em class="emphasis">before</em> coming to class on that date.</p>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_p02">Let’s take a look at how to use each step when reading.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preparing to Read</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p01">Start by thinking about why your instructor has chosen this text. Has the instructor said anything about the book or the author? Look at the table of contents; how does it compare with the course syllabus? What can you learn about the author from the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">front matter</a><span class="glossdef">A publishing term used to describe the first parts of the book that are not part of the actual text. The front matter may include a preface, a foreword, an introduction, biographical profiles of the authors, and the table of contents.</span></span> of the book (see <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_t01">Table 5.1 "Anatomy of a Textbook"</a>)? Understanding this background will give you the context of the book and help define what is most important in the text. Doing this exercise once per textbook will give you a great deal of insight throughout the course.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Now it is time to develop a plan of attack for your assignment. Your first step in any reading assignment is to understand the context of what you are about to read. Think of your reading assignment in relation to the large themes or goals the instructor has spelled out for the class. Remember that you are not merely reading—you are reading for a purpose. What parts of a reading assignment should you pay special attention to, and what parts can you browse through? As we mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, you will be expected to do a considerable amount of reading in college, and you will not get through it all by reading each and every word with a high level of focus and mental intensity. This is why it is so important to learn to define where to invest your efforts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p03">Open your text to the assigned pages. What is the chapter title? Is the chapter divided into sections? What are the section titles? Which sections are longer? Are there any illustrations? What are they about? Illustrations in books cost money, so chances are the author and publisher thought these topics were particularly important, or they would not have been included. How about tables? What kinds of information do they show? Are there bold or italicized words? Are these terms you are familiar with, or are they new to you? Are you getting a sense for what is important in the chapter? Use the critical thinking skills discussed in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch03#lochhaas-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking about Thought"</a> as you think about your observations. Why did the author choose to cover certain ideas and to highlight specific ideas with graphics or boldface fonts? What do they tell you about what will be most important for you in your course? What do you think your instructor wants you to get out of the assignment? Why?</p>

            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p04">Good textbooks are designed to help you learn, not just to present information. They differ from other types of academic publications intended to present research findings, advance new ideas, or deeply examine a specific subject. Textbooks have many features worth exploring because they can help you understand your reading better and learn more effectively. In your textbooks, look for the elements listed in the table below.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Now, before actually starting to read, try to give your reading more direction. Are you ever bored when reading a textbook? Students sometimes feel that about some of their textbooks. In this step, you create a purpose or quest for your reading, and this will help you become more actively engaged and less bored.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p06">Start by checking your attitude: if you are unhappy about the reading assignment and complaining that you even have to read it, you <em class="emphasis">will</em> have trouble with the reading. You need to get “psyched” for the assignment. Stoke your determination by setting yourself a reasonable time to complete the assignment and schedule some short breaks for yourself. Approach the reading with a sense of curiosity and thirst for new understanding. Think of yourself more as an investigator looking for answers than a student doing a homework assignment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p07">Take out your notebook for the class for which you are doing the reading. Remember the Cornell method of note taking from <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>? You will use the same format here with a narrow column on the left and a wide column on the right. This time, with reading, approach taking notes slightly differently. In the Cornell method used for class notes, you took notes in the right column and wrote in questions and comments in the left column after class as you reviewed your notes. When using this system with reading, write your questions about the reading first in the left column (spacing them well apart so that you have plenty of room for your notes while you read in the right column). From your preliminary scanning of the pages, as described previously, you should already have questions at your fingertips.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_p08">Use your critical thinking skill of questioning what the author is saying. Turn the title of each major section of the reading into a question and write it down in your left column of your notes. For example, if the section title is “The End of the Industrial Revolution,” you might write, “What caused the Industrial Revolution to end?” If the section title is “The Chemistry of Photosynthesis,” you might write, “What chemical reactions take place to cause photosynthesis, and what are the outcomes?” Note that your questions are related to the kind of material you are hearing about in class, and they usually require not a short answer but a thoughtful, complete understanding. Ideally, you should not already know the answer to the questions you are writing! (What fun is a quest if you already know each turn and strategy? Expect to learn something new in your reading even if you are familiar with the topic already.) Finally, also in the left column, jot down any keywords that appear in boldface. You will want to discover their definitions and the significance of each as you read.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a> you may have determined that you are more comfortable with the outline or concept map methods of note taking. You can use either of these methods also to prepare for reading. With the outline method, start with the chapter title as your primary heading, then create subheadings for each section, rephrasing each section title in terms of a question.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p02">If you are more comfortable using the concept map method, start with the chapter title as your center and create branches for each section within the chapter. Make sure you phrase each item as a question.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Now Read</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Now you are ready to start reading actively. Start by taking a look at your notes; they are your road map. What is the question you would like to answer in the first section? Before you start reading, reflect about what you already know about the subject. Even if you don’t know anything, this step helps put you in the right mind-set to accept new material. Now read through the entire section with the objective of understanding it. Follow these tips while reading, but do not start taking notes or highlighting text at this point:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Look for answers to the questions you wrote.</li>
            <li>Pay particular attention to the first and last lines of each paragraph.</li>
            <li>Think about the relationships among section titles, boldface words, and graphics.</li>
            <li>Skim quickly over parts of the section that are not related to the key questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s02_p02">After reading the section, can you answer the section question you earlier wrote in your notes? Did you discover additional questions that you should have asked or that were not evident from the title of the section? Write them down now on your notes page. Can you define the keywords used in the text? If you can’t do either of these things, go back and reread the section.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Capture the Key Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p01">Once you can answer your questions effectively and can define the new and keywords, it is time to commit these concepts to your notes and to your memory. Start by writing the answers to your questions in your notes in the right column. Also define the keywords you found in the reading.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Now is also the time to go back and reread the section with your highlighter or pencil to call out key ideas and words and make notes in your margins. Marking up your book may go against what you were told in high school, when the school owned the books and expected to use them year after year. In college, <em class="emphasis">you</em> bought the book. Make it truly yours. Although some students may tell you that you can get more cash by selling a used book that is not marked up, this should <em class="emphasis">not</em> be a concern at this time—that’s not nearly as important as understanding the reading and doing well in the class!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p03">The purpose of marking your textbook is to make it your personal studying assistant with the key ideas called out in the text. Most readers tend to highlight too much, however, hiding key ideas in a sea of yellow lines. When it comes to highlighting, less is more. Think critically before you highlight. Your choices will have a big impact on what you study and learn for the course. Make it your objective to highlight no more than 10 percent of the text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p04">Use your pencil also to make annotations in the margin. Use a symbol like an exclamation mark (<em class="emphasis">!</em>) or an asterisk (<em class="emphasis">*</em>) to mark an idea that is particularly important. Use a question mark (<em class="emphasis">?</em>) to indicate something you don’t understand or are unclear about. Box new words, then write a short definition in the margin. Use “TQ” (for “test question”) or some other shorthand or symbol to signal key things that may appear in test or quiz questions. Write personal notes on items where you disagree with the author. Don’t feel you have to use the symbols listed here; create your own if you want, but be consistent. Your notes won’t help you if the first question you later have is “I wonder what I meant by that?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p05">If you are reading an essay from a magazine or an academic journal, remember that such articles are typically written in response to other articles. In <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>, you learned to be on the lookout for signal words when you listen. This applies to reading, too. You’ll need to be especially alert to signals like “according to” or “Jones argues,” which make it clear that the ideas don’t belong to the author of the piece you are reading. Be sure to note when an author is quoting someone else or summarizing another person’s position. Sometimes, students in a hurry to get through a complicated article don’t clearly distinguish the author’s ideas from the ideas the author argues against. Other words like “yet” or “however” indicate a turn from one idea to another. Words like “critical,” “significant,” and “important” signal ideas you should look at closely.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s03_p06">After annotating, you are ready to read the next section.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reviewing What You Read</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s04_p01">When you have completed each of the sections for your assignment, you should review what you have read. Start by answering these questions: “What did I learn?” and “What does it mean?” Next, write a summary of your assigned reading, in your own words, in the box at the base of your notepaper. Working from your notes, cover up the answers to your questions and answer each of your questions aloud. (Yes, out loud. Remember from <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a> that memory is improved by using as many senses as possible?) Think about how each idea relates to material the instructor is covering in class. Think about how this new knowledge may be applied in your next class.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s04_p02">If the text has review questions at the end of the chapter, answer those, too. Talk to other students about the reading assignment. Merge your reading notes with your class notes and review both together. How does your reading increase your understanding of what you have covered in class and vice versa?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Strategies for Textbook Reading</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s05_p01">The four steps to active reading provide a proven approach to effective learning from texts. Following are some strategies you can use to enhance your reading even further:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pace yourself.</strong> Figure out how much time you have to complete the assignment. Divide the assignment into smaller blocks rather than trying to read the entire assignment in one sitting. If you have a week to do the assignment, for example, divide the work into five daily blocks, not seven; that way you won’t be behind if something comes up to prevent you from doing your work on a given day. If everything works out on schedule, you’ll end up with an extra day for review.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Schedule your reading.</strong> Set aside blocks of time, preferably at the time of the day when you are most alert, to do your reading assignments. Don’t just leave them for the end of the day after completing written and other assignments.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get yourself in the right space.</strong> Choose to read in a quiet, well-lit space. Your chair should be comfortable but provide good support. Libraries were designed for reading—they should be your first option! Don’t use your bed for reading textbooks; since the time you were read bedtime stories, you have probably associated reading in bed with preparation for sleeping. The combination of the cozy bed, comforting memories, and dry text is sure to invite some shut-eye!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid distractions.</strong> Active reading takes place in your short-term memory. Every time you move from task to task, you have to “reboot” your short-term memory and you lose the continuity of active reading. Multitasking—listening to music or texting on your cell while you read—will cause you to lose your place and force you to start over again. Every time you lose focus, you cut your effectiveness and increase the amount of time you need to complete the assignment.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid reading fatigue.</strong> Work for about fifty minutes, and then give yourself a break for five to ten minutes. Put down the book, walk around, get a snack, stretch, or do some deep knee bends. Short physical activity will do wonders to help you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read your most difficult assignments early</strong> in your reading time, when you are freshest.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make your reading interesting.</strong> Try connecting the material you are reading with your class lectures or with other chapters. Ask yourself where you disagree with the author. Approach finding answers to your questions like an investigative reporter. Carry on a mental conversation with the author.</li>

Many students are tempted to skip over graphic material and focus only on the reading. Don’t. Take the time to read and understand your textbook’s graphics.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Science occurs through the experimental process: posing hypotheses, and then using experimental data to prove or disprove them. When reading scientific texts, look for hypotheses and list them in the left column of your notes pages. Then make notes on the proof (or disproof) in the right column. In scientific studies these are as important as the questions you ask for other texts. Think critically about the hypotheses and the experiments used to prove or disprove them. Think about questions like these:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Can the experiment or observation be repeated? Would it reach the same results?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Sciences Texts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s03_p01">Social sciences texts, such as those for history, economics, and political science classes, often involve interpretation where the authors’ points of view and theories are as important as the facts they present. Put your critical thinking skills into overdrive when you are reading these texts. As you read, ask yourself questions such as the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Why is the author using this argument?</li>

            <li>Do I agree with this argument?</li>
            <li>Would someone with a different point of view dispute this argument?</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s03_p02">Record your reflections in the margins and in your notes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s03_p03">Social science courses often require you to read primary source documents. Primary sources include documents, letters, diaries, newspaper reports, financial reports, lab reports, and records that provide firsthand accounts of the events, practices, or conditions you are studying. Start by understanding the author(s) of the document and his or her agenda. Infer their intended audience. What response did the authors hope to get from their audience? Do you consider this a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bias</a><span class="glossdef">A personal inclination that may prevent unprejudiced consideration of a question.</span></span>? How does that bias affect your thinking about the subject? Do you recognize personal biases that affect how you might interpret the document?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Foreign Language Texts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Reading texts in a foreign language is particularly challenging—but it also provides you with invaluable practice and many new vocabulary words in your “new” language. It is an effort that really pays off. Start by analyzing a short portion of the text (a sentence or two) to see what you do know. Remember that all languages are built on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">idioms</a><span class="glossdef">An expression whose meaning is not predictable by the meanings of the words that make it up; many slang expressions are idioms.</span></span> as much as on individual words. Do any of the phrase structures look familiar? Can you infer the meaning of the sentences? Do they make sense based on the context? If you still can’t make out the meaning, choose one or two words to look up in your dictionary and try again. Look for longer words, which generally are the nouns and verbs that will give you meaning sooner. Don’t rely on a dictionary (or an online translator); a word-for-word translation does not always yield good results. For example, the Spanish phrase “Entre y tome asiento” might correctly be translated (word for word) as “Between and drink a seat,” which means nothing, rather than its actual meaning, “Come in and take a seat.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s04_p02">Reading in a foreign language is hard and tiring work. Make sure you schedule significantly more time than you would normally allocate for reading in your own language and reward yourself with more frequent breaks. But don’t shy away from doing this work; the best way to learn a new language is practice, practice, practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Note to English-language learners:</strong> You may feel that every book you are assigned is in a foreign language. If you do struggle with the high reading level required of college students, check for college resources that may be available to ESL (English as a second language) learners. Never feel that those resources are only for weak students. As a second-language learner, you possess a rich linguistic experience that many American-born students should envy. You simply need to account for the difficulties you’ll face and (like anyone learning a new language) practice, practice, practice.</p>

In the translation window, type in a phrase that you or your friends might say in your daily conversations, including any slang terms. Translate it to another language (any language will do) and then copy the translation. Then open a new translation window, paste the translated phrase, and translate back from that language to English. Does it match your original phrase? Try this with other languages to see if your results vary. What does this tell you about automated translation programs?</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s05_l01">
            <li>Don’t expect that you will often get long periods of uninterrupted reading time. Find or create short periods of time to do things like scanning the assignment and preparing your questions.</li>
            <li>Schedule your heavy reading for early in the morning or late at night when the children are sleeping. Don’t use that precious uninterrupted time for watching television or washing the dishes; those can be done when the kids are awake.</li>
            <li>Read to your children and then tell them it’s time for everybody to read their own book. (Even very young children like to “read” books by looking at the pictures.) You’ll be surprised how long kids will read, especially when they see Mommy and Daddy reading, too.</li>
            <li>Take your reading with you. You can get a lot of reading done while waiting for your children during music or dance class or soccer practice, or while you wait to pick them up at school.</li>
            <li>Share child-care responsibilities with other students who also have children. This can buy an additional big block of reading time for each of you.</li>

The following five steps will help you understand the “story behind the story” in online materials and also evaluate the reliability of the material, especially if this is a reading you selected yourself for research or independent work.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s03_s06_l01">
            <li>Look at the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">URL</a><span class="glossdef">An Internet address; URL stands for “uniform resource locator.”</span></span>, the Web address. It can give you important information about the reliability and intentions of the site. Start with the page publisher (the words following the “www” or between the “http//” and the first single backslash). Have you heard of this source before? If so, would you consider it a reliable source for the kind of material you are about to read? For example, you might happen upon an article about cholesterol with this URL: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1516">http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1516</a>. The page publisher identifier shows this is the Web site of the American Heart Association, a reputable source of health information. Now consider the domain type in the URL, which follows the period after the publisher. “.com” and “.biz” are used by commercial enterprises, “.org” is normally used by nonprofit organizations, and “.edu” is reserved for educational institutions. None of these is necessarily bad or good, but it may give you a sense of the motivation for publishing this material. For example, a different article about cholesterol on a pharmaceutical company’s Web site might be biased toward treatment of high cholesterol with a drug the company makes.</li>
            <li>Look at the page’s perimeter and the “masthead” at the top of the page. What name is listed there? Is it the same entity as the one listed as the publisher in the URL? Are you dealing with a company or the Web site of an individual—and how might that affect the quality of the information on this site? What can you learn from poking around with navigation tabs or buttons: what do they tell you about the objective of the Web site? Look for a tab labeled “About Us” or “Biography”; those pages will give you additional background on the writer.</li>
            <li>Check the quality of the information. Based on what you learned earlier, ask yourself if the information from this Web site is reliable for your needs. If the material you are reading was originally published elsewhere, was that publication reputable, such as an academic or peer-reviewed journal or a well-known newspaper? If you need the most up-to-date information, check the bottom of the page, where a “last modified” date may be shown. Does the author reference reliable sources? What links does the author offer to other Web sites? Are they active and reputable?</li>
            <li>Consider what others are saying about the site. Does the author offer references, reviews, or quotes about the material? Check blogs to see what other people think of the author or Web site by searching for the title of the article together with the word “review” or “blog.” Enter the Web site’s URL in the search engine at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.Alexa.com">http://www.Alexa.com</a> to see what other Web sites link to the one you are reading.</li>
            <li>Trust your impressions about the material. You have recently been exposed to related material in your class and textbooks. What does your “gut” say about the material? Ask yourself why the Web site was written. (To inform and provide data or facts? To sell something? To promote a cause? To parody?) If you are unsure of the quality of the information, don’t use it or check first with your instructor or college librarian before you do.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p01">Both leaders and advertisers inspire people to take action by choosing their words carefully and using them precisely. A good vocabulary is essential for success in any role that involves communication, and just about every role in life requires good communication skills. We include this section on vocabulary in this chapter on reading because of the connections between vocabulary building and reading. Building your vocabulary will make your reading easier, and reading is the best way to build your vocabulary.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p02">Learning new words can be fun and does not need to involve tedious rote memorization of word lists. The first step, as in any other aspect of the learning cycle, is to prepare yourself to learn. Consciously decide that you want to improve your vocabulary; decide you want to be a student of words. Work to become more aware of the words around you: the words you hear, the words you read, the words you say, and those you write.</p>

        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p04">Recruit a friend you spend a lot of time with. Give them an index card with the following words written on it and ask them to keep a tally of the number of times you say these words sometime when you are together for an hour or more. If you have a small recorder, give it to the person and ask them to record you at a time you are not aware of it.</p>

        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p06">Are there words you constantly overuse? Were you surprised at how often you used some of these expressions? Now that you are aware of the frequency you use certain expressions, what strategies can you use to control or substitute more articulate and expressive words for them?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p07">Building a stronger vocabulary should start with a strong foundation of healthy word use. Just as you can bring your overuse of certain words to your conscious awareness in the previous activity, think about the kinds of words you should be using more frequently. Some of the words you might consciously practice are actually very simple ones you already know but significantly underuse or use imprecisely. For example, many students say he or she “goes” instead of he or she “says.” If you take it a step further, you can consider more accurate choices still. Perhaps, he “claims” or she “argues.” Maybe he “insists” or “assumes.” Or it could be that she “believes” or she “suggests.” This may seem like a small matter, but it’s important from both a reader’s and a writer’s perspective to distinguish among the different meanings. And you can develop greater awareness by bringing some of these words into your speech.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_p08">These habits are easier to put into action if you have more and better material to draw upon: a stronger vocabulary. The following tips will help you gain and correctly use more words.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch05_s04_l03">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be on the lookout for new words.</strong> Most will come to you as you read, but they may also appear in an instructor’s lecture, a class discussion, or a casual conversation with a friend. They may pop up in random places like billboards, menus, or even online ads!</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write down the new words you encounter, along with the sentences in which they were used.</strong> Do this in your notes with new words from a class or reading assignment. If a new word does not come from a class, you can write it on just about anything, but make sure you write it. Many word lovers carry a small notepad or a stack of index cards specifically for this purpose.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Infer the meaning of the word.</strong> The context in which the word is used may give you a good clue about its meaning. Do you recognize a common word root in the word? (Check <a class="xref" href="#lochhaas-ch05_s04_t01">Table 5.3 "Common Latin and Greek Word Roots"</a> for common roots.) What do <em class="emphasis">you</em> think it means?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look up the word in a dictionary.</strong> Do this as soon as possible (but only after inferring the meaning). When you are reading, you should have a dictionary at hand for this purpose. In other situations, do this within a couple hours, definitely during the same day. How does the dictionary definition compare with what you inferred?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write the word in a sentence, ideally one that is relevant to you.</strong> If the word has more than one definition, write a sentence for each.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Say the word out loud</strong> and then say the definition and the sentence you wrote.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use the word.</strong> Find occasion to use the word in speech or writing over the next two days.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Schedule a weekly review</strong> with yourself to go over your new words and their meanings.</li>

            <li>When scanning a reading, look for clues to what might be important. Read the section titles, study illustrations, and look for keywords and boldface text.</li>
            <li>Do not highlight your text until you have read a section completely to be sure you understand the context. Then go back and highlight and annotate your text during a second read-through.</li>
            <li>Think critically about what you are reading. Do you agree with what the author is saying? How does it relate to the rest of the material in the course? What does this new material mean to you in “real life”?</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch05_s05_l03">
            <li>Do all the exercises in math textbooks; apply the formulas to real-world situations.</li>
            <li>Practice “reading” the illustrations. Each type of graphic material has its own strength or purpose.</li>
            <li>Look for statements of hypotheses and experimental design when reading science texts.</li>
            <li>History, economics, and political science texts are heavily influenced by interpretation. Think critically about what you are reading.</li>
            <li>Working with foreign language texts requires more time and more frequent breaks. Don’t rely on word-for-word translations.</li>
            <li>If you need to read with children around, don’t put off your reading until you have a large block of time; learn to read in short periods as available.</li>
            <li>When reading on the Internet, be extra diligent to evaluate the source of the material to decide how reliable that source may be.</li>
            <li>If English is your second language, seek out resources that may be offered on campus. In any case, be patient with the process of mastering college-level English. And always remember this: what feels like a disadvantage in one situation can be a great gift in another situation.</li>

            <li>Reading and vocabulary development are closely linked. A stronger vocabulary makes reading easier and more fun; the best way to build a vocabulary is to read.</li>
