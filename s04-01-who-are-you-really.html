        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Look back at the values you rated highly (4 or 5) in Activity 2, which probably give a good indication of how you enjoy spending your time. But now look at these things you value in a different way. Think about how each relates to how you think you need to manage your time effectively while in college. Most college students feel they don’t have enough time for everything they like to do. Do some of the activities you value most contribute to your college experience, or will they distract you from being a good student?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s02_p05">Students who enter college with their eyes open and who think about their own values and motivations will be more successful. If you have a good idea of what you want from life, the rest of it can be learned. We’ll start right away in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a> by helping you stay motivated and manage your time well.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Thinking Ahead to a Major and Career</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p01">If you’ve just begun college, should you already know what career you seek in the future and what courses you should take or what you should <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">major</a><span class="glossdef">A subject or field of study chosen by a college student representing his or her principal interest.</span></span> in? Good question!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p02">Some students say they have known from a very early age what they want to do after college, choose the college that is best for that plan, never waiver from the plan and choose each course with the one goal in mind, and then enter their chosen career after college or graduate school. At the other extreme, some students have only a vague sense of direction before beginning college, take a wide variety of courses, select a major only when they reach the point that they must major in something (or perhaps change majors multiple times), and then after college choose to work in an entirely different field.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p03">Some students choose to major in an academic subject simply because they enjoy that subject, never concerned with what kind of job they may get afterward. The traditional idea of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">liberal arts education</a><span class="glossdef">A college program that provides general knowledge about the humanities, arts, and natural and social sciences, rather than professional or technical subjects.</span></span> is that you can go to college not to prepare for a specific career but to become a well-educated person who is then in a better position to work in any number of careers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p04">None of these different approaches to choosing a major and a career is better than others. All students receive the many benefits of college, and all are likely to find a more fulfilling career.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p05">So where are <em class="emphasis">you</em> in this great variety of attitudes about career and major choices?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p06">Assuming you are still early in your college program, the take-home message here is that you don’t need to make any decisions yet. Chances are, as you take courses in a variety of subjects and meet people in many different fields, you’ll naturally discover something about what you really enjoy doing and what career options you may choose to pursue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p07">On the other hand, help is available for discovering your interests, strengths, and personality factors related to careers. You can learn a lot about your options and what you would be good at by visiting your college’s advising or counseling department. Almost all colleges have tools to help you discover what careers you would most enjoy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p08">The Strong Interest Inventory is such an assessment tool used by many colleges and universities. You answer a series of simple questions, and the computer-scored tabulation provides information about your interests, strengths, and personality related to different types of careers. This tool can also suggest specific courses, jobs and internships, and extracurricular activities relevant to personal and career interests. Ask your college’s career counseling center if such a tool is available.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p09">Another widely used tool is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The MBTI is a personality inventory that identifies you as one of sixteen distinct personality types. Each personality type correlates with happiness in certain careers. Ask your college’s career counselor to see if the MBTI is available for you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p10">A free online assessment, like the CareerLink Inventory (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpcfaculty.net/CL/climain.htm">http://www.mpcfaculty.net/CL/climain.htm</a>), is a relatively simple tool that can teach you a lot about yourself. Follow the steps in the “Outside the Book” section to maximize your results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s03_p11">Although there’s nothing wrong with starting out without an intended major or career path, take care not to accidentally take courses that end up not counting toward your program goal or degree. You could end up in college longer than needed or have to pay for additional courses. Be sure to read your college catalog carefully and to talk to your academic advisor.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Your Past Educational Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s04_p01">It is important to understand how college is different from high school and how well your own past educational experiences have prepared you for what you will find in college. This is another way in which entering college “with your eyes wide open” will prove beneficial.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s04_p02">College is a unique experience for all students—whether you just graduated from high school or are returning to education after years of working. You are transitioning from one form of education to another. Some students have difficulty because of the differences between college and high school.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s04_p03">Generally speaking, however, the college experience is usually different from high school in these ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>Time management is more important in college because of varying class and work schedules and other time commitments.</li>
            <li>College instructors seldom seek you out to offer extra help if you’re falling behind. You are on your own and expected to do the work, meet deadlines, and so on, without someone looking over your shoulder.</li>
            <li>There may be no attendance policy for classes. You are expected to be mature enough to come to class without fear of penalties.</li>
            <li>Many classes are large, making it easy to feel lost in a crowd.</li>
            <li>Many instructors, especially in large classes, teach by lecture—which can be difficult for those whose high school teachers interacted a great deal with students.</li>
            <li>College courses require more study time and require you to work on your own.</li>
            <li>Your social and personal life in college may be less supervised. Younger students may experience a sudden increase in freedom to do what they want.</li>
            <li>You will meet more people from more diverse backgrounds in college.</li>
            <li>All of these differences, along with a change in living situation for many students, can lead to emotional changes—both positive and negative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s04_p04">What does all this add up to? For some students, the sudden independence and freedom can lead in negative directions: sleeping late, skipping classes, missing deadlines, failing to study adequately for tests, and so on. Other students who are highly motivated and work hard in their classes may also have difficulty transitioning to the higher academic standards of college. Suddenly, you’re responsible for everything. That can be thrilling but also a challenge to get used to. All the chapters in this book will help you make this transition successfully.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Liking Yourself as a Student and Why That Matters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p01">Of all the factors that affect how well one does in college, attitude is probably the single most important. A positive attitude leads to motivation, and someone who is strongly motivated to succeed can overcome obstacles that may occur.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p02">In <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>, we’ll discuss things you can do to keep a positive attitude about college and stay motivated in your studies. But your attitude toward yourself as a student matters just as much. Now that you are in college, you are a new person, not just the same person who happens now to be a college student. What do you think of this new person?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p03">If you’re feeling excited, enthusiastic, capable, and confident in your new life—great! Skip ahead to the next section. But if you’re less sure how well you’ll do in your new role, take comfort in knowing that you’re not alone. A lot of new college students, once they begin experiencing the differences from high school, start having doubts. Some may start to feel “I’m not a good enough student” or “I can’t keep up with all this.” Some may become fearful or apathetic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p04">These feelings, while a perfectly natural response to a big change in one’s life, can hinder one’s motivation and ability to succeed. If you think you can’t make it, that might become true. If you’re sure you’ll make it, you will.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p05">Again, we’ll ask you to think honestly about this. If you have these thoughts sometimes, why is that? Are you just reacting to a low grade on your first test? Are you just feeling this way because you see other students who look like they know what they’re doing and you’re feeling out of place? Most likely, if you have doubts about being able to do well, this is just a reaction to college being more difficult than what you’re used to. It’s mostly a matter of having the right skills for succeeding in college. This book will help you learn them—everything from how to study effectively, how to do better on tests, even how to read your textbooks more effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p06">Why is it that some students need to work on strengthening their skills after beginning college while others seem to waltz right in and do well from the start?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s05_p07">The answer sounds simple but is actually rather complex. There simply are many differences among people. There are differences among high schools as well as one’s past teachers, one’s peer group, one’s family, one’s cultural background, and many other factors. As a result of many different things, some students just need a little more help to succeed in college. No student is better or automatically more capable than another, however, and everyone can learn the skills to succeed.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Self-Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s06_p01">To succeed in college, you need to take control of your life. Gone are the days when you could just “cruise” through school, or life, or let others motivate you or establish schedules to manage your time. This change presents an exciting opportunity. It’s your first step in your new life and the key to your future. Here are a few thoughts to get you started in the right direction:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch01_s01_s06_l01">

            <li>

            <li>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Enjoy your life!</strong> Going to college might seem overwhelming at times, but no one is asking you to “give up your life” to succeed in college. Enjoy meeting new people, learning new things, and experiencing the diversity of the college experience. Most college graduates look back on their college years as one of the best periods in their whole lives!</li>
