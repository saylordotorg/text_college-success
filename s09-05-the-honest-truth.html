    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p01">Throughout this book we have focused on the active process of <em class="emphasis">learning</em>, not just on how to get good grades. The attitude of some students that grades are the end-all in academics has led many students to resort to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">academic dishonesty</a><span class="glossdef">Cheating or using any unauthorized or unacceptable material in academic activities such as assignments and tests; turning in work that is not your own under your name.</span></span> to try to get the best possible grades or handle the pressure of an academic program. Although you may be further tempted if you’ve heard people say, “Everybody does it,” or “It’s no big deal at my school,” you should be mindful of the consequences of cheating:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You don’t learn as much.</strong> Cheating may get you the right answer on a particular exam question, but it won’t teach you how to apply knowledge in the world after school, nor will it give you a foundation of knowledge for learning more advanced material. When you cheat, you cheat yourself out of opportunities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You risk failing the course or even expulsion from school.</strong> Each institution has its own definitions of and penalties for academic dishonesty, but most include cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication or falsification. The exact details of what is allowed or not allowed vary somewhat among different colleges and even instructors, so you should be sure to check your school’s Web site and your instructor’s guidelines to see what rules apply. Ignorance of the rules is seldom considered a valid defense.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating causes stress.</strong> Fear of getting caught will cause you stress and anxiety; this will get in the way of performing well with the information you <em class="emphasis">do</em> know.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You’re throwing away your money and time.</strong> Getting a college education is a big investment of money and effort. You’re simply not getting your full value when you cheat, because you don’t learn as much.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">You are trashing your integrity.</strong> Cheating once and getting away with it makes it easier to cheat again, and the more you cheat, the more comfortable you will feel with giving up your integrity in other areas of life—with perhaps even more serious consequences.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating lowers your self-esteem.</strong> If you cheat, you are telling yourself that you are simply not smart enough to handle learning. It also robs you of the feeling of satisfaction from genuine success.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p02">Technology has made it easier to cheat. Your credit card and an Internet connection can procure a paper for you on just about any subject and length. You can copy and paste for free from various Web sites. Students have made creative use of texting and video on their cell phones to gain unauthorized access to material for exams. But be aware that technology has also created ways for instructors to easily detect these forms of academic dishonesty. Most colleges make these tools available to their instructors. Instructors are also modifying their testing approaches to reduce potential academic misconduct by using methods that are harder to cheat at (such as in-class essays that evaluate <em class="emphasis">your</em> thinking and oral presentations).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p03">If you feel uneasy about doing something in your college work, trust your instincts. Confirm with the instructor that your intended form of research or use of material is acceptable. Cheating just doesn’t pay.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Examples of Academic Dishonesty</h3>
        <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_p04">Academic dishonesty can take many forms, and you should be careful to avoid them. The following list from Northwestern University is a clear and complete compilation of what most institutions will consider unacceptable academic behavior.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch06_s05_l03">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cheating:</strong> using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regrading; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting that work under one's own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plagiarism:</strong> submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one's own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Fabrication:</strong> falsifying or inventing any information, data or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Obtaining an Unfair Advantage:</strong> (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing library materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized collaboration on an academic assignment; (d) retaining, possessing, using or circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering with another student's academic work; or (f) otherwise undertaking activity with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over other students' academic work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty:</strong> (a) providing material, information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Falsification of Records and Official Documents:</strong> altering documents affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of permission, petition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official University document.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unauthorized Access</strong> to computerized academic or administrative records or systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access, or interfering with the use or availability of computer systems or information.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-lochhaas-fn06_001">Undergraduate Academic Conduct Committee of Northwestern University, “Definitions of Academic Violations,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html">http://www.northwestern.edu/uacc/defines.html</a> (accessed July 13, 2010).</span>
