        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_p01">What is a chapter on personal finances doing in a book on student success? If you’re a new college student you may not yet have money problems or issues—but most college students soon do. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a “traditional” college student enrolled in college just after high school or a “nontraditional” student returning to school.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_p02">Younger students are likely to confront money issues for several reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_l01">
            <li>If you are living away from home for the first time, you may have less experience setting and sticking to a budget and handling money in general.</li>
            <li>Because you need more time for studying and other aspects of college life, you may have less time to work and make money.</li>
            <li>Even if you receive financial support from your family, your funds are not unlimited, and you’ll need to learn to live within a budget.</li>
            <li>You will have many new expenses including tuition and fees, room and board or housing and food bills, books and supplies, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_p03">Nontraditional students who have worked or started a family before attending college may have already learned to manage their money well but usually still confront some financial issues:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_l02">
            <li>Because you need more time for studying and college, you likely have less time to work and make money.</li>
            <li>You will have many new expenses including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and so on.</li>
            <li>You are more likely to have to juggle a budget that may include a family, mortgage, and other established expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_p04">Almost everyone eventually has money issues at college, and they can impact your academic success. Money problems are stressful and can keep you from concentrating on your studies. Spending too much may lead you to work more hours than you might otherwise, giving you less time to study. Or you might take fewer classes and thus spend more years in college than needed. Worse yet, money problems cause many students to drop out of college entirely.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_p05">But it doesn’t have to be this hard. Like other skills, financial skills can be learned, and they have lifelong value. This chapter will help you</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch11_s00_l03">
            <li>set financial goals,</li>
            <li>consider jobs and making money,</li>
            <li>learn how to spend less and manage a budget,</li>
            <li>avoid credit card debt,</li>
            <li>determine how best to finance your college expenses.</li>
