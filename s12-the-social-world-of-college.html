        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s00_p01">New college students may not immediately realize that they’ve entered a whole new world at college, including a world of other people possibly very different from those they have known before. This is a very important dimension of college—almost as important as the learning that goes on inside the classroom. How you deal with the social aspects and diversity of college world has a large impact on your academic success.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s00_p02">All the topics covered in this chapter relate to the social world of college. Here you will gain some insight into the value of making new friends and getting along with the wide variety of people you will encounter on campus. You will learn why and how a broad diversity of people enriches the college experience and better prepare you for the world after college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s00_p03">Enter this new world with an open mind and you’ll gain many benefits. Even if you are taking a course or two at night and do not spend much of your day on campus, try to make the most of this experience. You’ll meet others who will challenge and stimulate you and broaden your thinking and emotional experiences.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Interdependence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p01">Humans are social creatures—it’s simply in our nature. We continually interact with other students and instructors, and we can learn a great deal from these interactions that heighten the learning process. This frequent interaction with others forms a state of interdependence. College students depend on their instructors, but just as importantly, they depend on other students in many ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p02">As important as our interactions with others are, we do not automatically possess the skills that help us form good relationships and make the most of our experiences. Consider how these two college students are different:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p03">John often arrives just as class is beginning and leaves immediately afterward. He makes little effort to talk with other students in the classroom, and after class he goes off to study alone or to his part-time job, where he spends most of his time at a computer screen. He is diligent in his studies and generally does well. After two months, he has not gotten to know his roommate very well, and he generally eats alone with a book in hand. He stops by to see his instructors in their offices only if he missed a class due to illness, and on weekends and holidays he often hangs out at his parents’ house or sees old friends.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p04">Kim likes to get to class early and sits near others so they can talk about the reading for class or compare notes about assignments. She enjoys running into other students she knows from her classes and usually stops to chat. Although she is an older working student who lives alone off campus, she often dines in a campus café and asks students she meets in her classes to join her. After two months, with the approach of midterms, she formed a study group with a couple other students. If she feels she doesn’t understand an important lecture topic very well, she gets to her instructor’s office a few minutes ahead of office hours to avoid missing out by having to wait in line. A few weeks into the term, she spent a weekend with a student from another country and learned much about a culture about which she had previously known little.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s01_p05">These students are very different. Which do you think is more fully enjoying the college experience? Which do you think is more likely to do well academically? Most of us fall somewhere between these two extremes, but we can learn to be more like Kim and more actively engage with others.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Recognize the Value of Social Interaction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_p01">Building good relationships is important for happiness and a successful college experience. College offers the opportunity to meet many people you would likely not meet otherwise in life. Make the most of this opportunity to gain a number of benefits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>A growing understanding of diverse other people, how they think, and what they feel that will serve you well throughout your life and in your future career</li>
            <li>A heightened sense of your own identity, especially as you interact with others with different personalities and from different backgrounds</li>
            <li>Emotional comfort from friendship with someone who understands you and with whom you can talk about your problems, joys, hopes, and fears</li>
            <li>An opportunity to grow with wider intellectual and emotional horizons</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s02_p02">College often offers an opportunity to be stimulated and excited by new relationships and interactions with people who will challenge your thinking and help you become your best.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making New Friends</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p01">Some people just make friends naturally, but many first-year college students are more shy or quiet and may need to actively seek new friends. Here are some starting points:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep all doors open for meeting new people.</strong> If you live in a dorm, literally keep the door open. Try to sit with different people at meals so you can get to know them better. Study in a common area or lounge where you’ll be among others.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be open in your interests.</strong> Don’t limit yourself to people who share only certain interests. Meeting people by studying together is an excellent way to get to know people with different interests.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t try to get involved in everything going on around you.</strong> Committing to too many activities or joining too many social groups will spread your time too thin, and you may not spend enough time with anyone to get to know them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Let others see who you really are.</strong> Let people get to know the things you’re interested in, your real passions. People who really know you are more likely to become good friends.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make an effort to get to know others, too.</strong> Show some interest. Don’t talk just about <em class="emphasis">your</em> interests—ask them about theirs. Show others that you’re interested, that you think they’re worth spending time with, and that you really do want to get to know them.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Once a friendship has started, be a good friend.</strong> Respect your friends for what they are and don’t criticize them or talk about them behind their back. Give emotional support when your friends need it and accept their support as well when you need it.</li>

        <div class="callout editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Are You Shy?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p02">If you’re shy, try meeting and talking to people in situations where you can interact one-to-one, such as talking with another student after class. Start with what you have in common—“How’d you do on the test?”—and let the conversation grow from there. Avoid the emotional trap of thinking everyone but you is making new friends and start some conversations with others who look interesting to you. You’ll soon find other “shy” or quiet people eager to interact with you as well and get to know you.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s03_p03">Shy people may be more likely to feel lonely at times, especially while still feeling new at college. Loneliness is usually a temporary emotional state, however. For tips for how to overcome feelings of loneliness, see the section on loneliness in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10_s06#lochhaas-ch10_s06">Section 10.6 "Emotional Health and Happiness"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p01">Communication is at the core of almost all social interactions, including those involved in friendships and relationships with your instructors. Communication with others has a huge effect on our lives, what we think and feel, and what and how we learn. Communication is, many would say, what makes us human.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p02">Oral communication involves not only speech and listening, of course, but also <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonverbal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that occurs outside of the written and spoken word, including meanings inferred from facial expressions and body positions.</span></span>: facial expressions, tone of voice, and many other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">body language</a><span class="glossdef">Another term for forms of nonverbal communication, including gestures, postures, and facial expressions.</span></span> signals that affect the messages sent and received.

When the nonverbal message is inconsistent with the verbal (spoken) message, just as when the verbal message itself is unclear because of poorly chosen words or vague explanations, then miscommunication may occur.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p03">Miscommunication is at the root of many misunderstandings among people and makes it difficult to build relationships.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p04"><a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch07#lochhaas-ch07">Chapter 7 "Interacting with Instructors and Classes"</a> discusses oral communication skills in general and guidelines for communicating well with your instructors. The same communication skills are important for building and maintaining significant relationships.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p05">Remember that communication is a two-way process. Listening skills are critical for most college students simply because many of us may not have learned how to really listen to another person. Here are some guidelines for how to listen effectively:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Talk less to listen more.</strong> Most people naturally like to share their thoughts and feelings, and some people almost seem unable to stop talking long enough to ever listen to another person. Try this: next time you’re in a conversation with another student, deliberately try not to speak very much but give the other person a chance to speak fully. You may notice a big difference in how much you gain from the conversation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask questions.</strong> To keep the conversational ball rolling, show your interest in the other person by asking them about things they are saying. This helps the other person feel that you are interested in them and helps build the relationship.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Watch and respond to the other person’s body language.</strong> You’ll learn much more about their feelings for what they’re saying than if you listen only to their words.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Show the other person that you’re really listening and that you care.</strong> Make eye contact and respond appropriately with nods and brief comments like “That’s interesting!” or “I know what you mean” or “Really?” Be friendly, smile when appropriate, and encourage the person to keep speaking.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Give the other person</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">feedback</a><span class="glossdef">Evaluative information derived from a person’s reaction or response to a particular activity, such as from a listener’s response to a speaker.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> Show you understand by saying things like “So you’re saying that…” or asking a question that demonstrates you’ve been following what they’re saying and want to know more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p06">As you learn to improve your listening skills, think also about what you are saying yourself and how. Here are additional guidelines for effective speaking:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be honest, but don’t be critical</strong>. Strongly disagreeing may only put the other person on the defensive—an emotion sure to disrupt the hope for good communication. You can disagree, but be respectful to keep the conversation from becoming emotional. Say “I don’t know, I think that maybe it’s…” instead of “That’s crazy! What’s <em class="emphasis">really</em> going on is.…”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look for common ground.</strong> Make sure that your side of a conversation relates to what the other person is saying and that it focuses on what you have in common. There’s almost no better way to stop a conversation dead in its tracks than to ignore everything the other person has just said and launch into an unrelated story or idea of your own.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid sarcasm and irony unless you know the person well.</strong> Sarcasm is easily misunderstood and may be interpreted as an attack on the other person’s ideas or statements.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t try to talk like the other person,</strong> especially if the person is from a different ethnic or cultural background or speaks with an accent or heavy slang. The other person will feel that you are imitating them and maybe even making fun of them. Be yourself and speak naturally.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">While not imitating the other person, relate to his or her personality and style of thinking.</strong> We do not speak to our parents or instructors the exact same way we speak to our closest friends, nor should we speak to someone we’ve just met the same way. Show your respect for the other person by keeping the conversation on an appropriate level.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Remember that</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assertive communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that is self-assured, positive, and honest but still tactful and nonaggressive.</span></span> <strong class="emphasis bold">is better than passive or aggressive communication.</strong> “Assertive” in this context means you are honest and direct in stating your ideas and thoughts; you are confident and clear and willing to discuss your ideas while still respecting the thoughts and ideas of others. A passive communicator is reluctant to speak up, seems to agree with everything others say, hesitates to say anything that others might disagree with, and therefore seldom communicates much at all. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Passive communication</a><span class="glossdef">Communication characterized by acceptance of things expressed by others, without taking an active or confident role in sharing one’s own ideas or thoughts.</span></span> simply is not a real exchange in communication. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Aggressive communication</a><span class="glossdef">One-sided communication in which a speaker attacks what others say or uses a pushy, domineering style to express ideas or thoughts.</span></span>, at the other extreme, is often highly critical of the thoughts and ideas of others. This communication style may be sarcastic, emotional, and even insulting. Real communication is not occurring because others are not prompted to respond honestly and openly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose your conversations wisely.</strong> Recognize that you don’t have to engage in all conversations. Make it your goal to form relationships and engage in interactions that help you learn and grow as a person. College life offers plenty of opportunities for making relationships and interacting with others if you keep open to them, so you needn’t try to participate in every social situation around you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s04_p07">Some students may have difficulty in the opposite direction: their social lives may become so rich or so time consuming that they have problems balancing their social lives with their schoolwork. Online social media, for example, may eat up a lot of time.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Online Social Networking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p01">Most college students know all about Facebook, Twitter, blogging, chat rooms, and other <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social networking</a><span class="glossdef">The use of a Web site to connect with people who share personal or professional interests.</span></span> sites. Current studies reveal that over 90 percent of all college students use Facebook or MySpace regularly, although older students use these sites less commonly. The media have often emphasized negative stories involving safety concerns, obsessive behavior, a perceived superficiality of social interaction online, and so on. But more recently, online social networking has been found to have several benefits. Many of those who once criticized Facebook and MySpace are now regularly networking among themselves via LinkedIn, Plaxo, and other “professional” networking sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p02">Following are some of the benefits of Facebook—some clear to those using it, others revealed only recently by research in the social sciences:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_l01">
            <li>Facebook and other forms of online networking makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family at a geographical distance. College students who have moved away from former friends seem to make the transition more easily when they stay in touch. Maintaining past relationships does not prevent most people from making new friends at college.</li>
            <li>Facebook provides users with increased “social capital,” which is a sum of resources gained through one’s relationships with people. Facebook users gain information, opportunities for participation in activities and groups, greater knowledge about others, some interaction skills, and so forth. Social capital is also associated with self-esteem, success in some endeavors, and general happiness.</li>
            <li>Facebook makes it easier for people who are shy or otherwise slow to initiate or respond to interactions with others to participate socially in a group. Online network sites also offer an outlet for self-expression and sharing.</li>
            <li>For many college students, interactions on Facebook strengthen personal relationships rather than detracting from them.</li>
            <li>Acknowledging that online social networking is a reality for most college students, many college administrators and instructors also use it to stay in better touch with students, to provide information and encouragement, and to help students experience the full richness of the college experience. Your college may have a Facebook page where you can learn much about things happening around campus, and you may even receive tweets about important announcements.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_f01">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p03">Still, online social networking is not 100 percent beneficial for all college students. Someone who becomes obsessed with constantly updating their profile or attracting a huge number of friends can spend so much time at their computer that they miss out on other important aspects of college life. Hopefully by now everyone knows why you should never post compromising or inappropriate photos or information about yourself anywhere online, even as a joke: many employers, college admissions offices, and others may find this compromising material in the future and deny you the job, internship, graduate program, or other position that you want. It’s important also to protect your identity and privacy on online sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s05_p04">Overall, online networking in moderation can help enrich one’s life. When used to build relationships, gain information, and stay in touch with a larger community, it can contribute to success in college. Most college students use Facebook ten to thirty minutes a day. If you’re spending more than that, you might ask yourself if you’re missing out on something else.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Balancing Schoolwork and Social Life</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_p01">If there’s one thing true of virtually all college students, it’s that you don’t have enough time to do everything you want. Once you’ve developed friendships within the college community and have an active social life, you may feel you don’t have enough time for your studies and other activities such as work. For many students, the numerous social opportunities of college become a distraction, and with less attention to one’s studies, academic performance can drop. Here are some tips for balancing your social life with your studies:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep working on your time management skills,</strong> as you learned in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>. You can’t just “go with the flow” and hope that, after spending time with friends, you have enough time (and energy) left over for studying. Make a study schedule that provides enough time for what you need to do. Study first; socialize after.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep working on your study skills,</strong> as you learned in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch04#lochhaas-ch04">Chapter 4 "Listening, Taking Notes, and Remembering"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch05#lochhaas-ch05">Chapter 5 "Reading to Learn"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>. When you have only a limited amount of time for studying, be sure you’re using that time as effectively as possible as you read assignments and prepare for class, organize your notes after class, and prepare for tests.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you can’t resist temptations, reduce them.</strong> If you are easily distracted by the opportunity to talk with your roommate, spouse, or family members because you study where you live, then go to the library to study.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make studying a social experience.</strong> If your studying keeps you so busy that you feel like you don’t have much of a social life, form a study group. You will learn more than you would alone by gaining from the thoughts of others, and you can enjoy interacting with others without falling behind.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your social life from affecting your studying.</strong> Simply scheduling study time doesn’t mean you’ll use it well. If you stayed up late the night before, you may not today be able to concentrate well as you study for that big test. This is another reason for good time management and scheduling your time well, looking ahead.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get help if you need it.</strong> If you’re still having difficulty balancing your study time with other activities, talk with your academic advisor or a counselor. Maybe something else is keeping you from doing your best. Maybe you need some additional study skills or you need to get some extra help from a tutor or campus study center. Remember, your college wants you to succeed and will try to help those who seek help.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s06_s01_p01">Fraternities and sororities appeal to many students on many campuses. You meet a lot of people quickly and have a social life provided for you almost automatically, with many events and parties as well as usually an active house life. Many people have formed lasting, even lifelong relationships with their fraternity and sorority friends. On the other hand, this living and social experience may limit the kinds of people you meet and present fewer opportunities to interact with others outside the Greek system. If there are frequent activities, it may be important to learn to say no at time when studying becomes a priority. If you are interested in but not yet committed to this life, it’s worthwhile to find out what the houses at your school are really like, consider what your life would likely be like in a fraternity or sorority, and think about how it may impact your college goals.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Overcoming Difficulties and Resolving Conflicts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p01">Conflicts among people who are interacting are natural. People have many differences in opinions, ideas, emotions, and behaviors, and these differences sometimes cause conflicts. Here are just a few examples of conflicts that may occur among college students:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_l01">
            <li>Your roommate is playing loud music in your room, and you need some quiet to study for a test.</li>
            <li>You want to have a nice dinner out, but your spouse wants to save the money to buy new furniture.</li>
            <li>Your instructor gave you a C on a paper because it lacks some of the required elements, but you feel it deserves a better grade because you think it accomplished more important goals.</li>
            <li>Others at your Greek house want to invite only members of other fraternities and sororities to an upcoming party, but you want the party to be more inclusive and to invite more diverse students.</li>
            <li>Your partner wants to have sex with you, but you want to wait until you get protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p02">So how can such conflicts be resolved? Two things are necessary for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflict resolution</a><span class="glossdef">A step-by-step process designed to resolve a dispute or disagreement.</span></span> that does not leave one or more of the people involved feeling negative about the outcome: attitude and communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p03">A conflict cannot be resolved satisfactorily unless all people involved have the right attitude:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Respect the options and behaviors of others.</strong> Accept that people are not all alike and learn to celebrate your differences. Most situations do not involve a single right or wrong answer.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be open minded.</strong> Just because at first you are sure that that you are right, do not close the door to other possibilities. Look at the other’s point of view. Be open to change—even when that means accepting constructive criticism.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Calm down.</strong> You can’t work together to resolve a conflict while you’re still feeling strong emotions. Agree with the other to wait until you’re both able to discuss it without strong emotions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recognize the value of compromise.</strong> Even if you disagree after calmly talking over an issue, accept that as a human reality and understand that a compromise may be necessary in order to get along with others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p04">With the right attitude, you can then work together to resolve the issue. This process depends on good communication:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_l03">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Listen.</strong> Don’t simply argue for your position, but listen carefully to what the other says. Pay attention to their body language as you try to understand their point of view and ask questions to ensure that you do. Paraphrase what you think you hear to give the other a chance to correct any misunderstanding.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use “I statements” rather than “you statements.”</strong> Explain your point of view about the situation in a way that does not put the other person on the defensive and evoke emotions that make resolution more difficult. Don’t say, “You’re always playing loud music when I’m trying to study.” Instead, say, “I have difficulty studying when you play loud music, and that makes me frustrated and irritable.” Don’t blame the other for the problem—that would just get emotions flowing again.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Brainstorm together to find a solution that satisfies both of you.</strong> Some compromise is usually needed, but that is usually not difficult to reach when you’re calm and have the right attitude about working together on a solution. In some cases, you may simply have to accept a result that you still do not agree with, simply in order to move on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p05">The process of conflict resolution is discussed more fully in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>. In most cases, when the people involved have a good attitude and are open to compromise, conflicts can be resolved successfully.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_p06">Yet sometimes there seems to be no resolution. Sometimes the other person may simply be difficult and refuse to even try to work out a solution. Regrettably, not everyone on or off campus is mature enough to be open to other perspectives. With some interpersonal conflicts, you may simply have to decide not to see that person anymore or find other ways to avoid the conflict in the future. But remember, most conflicts can be solved among adults, and it’s seldom a good solution to run away from a problem that will continue to surface and keep you from being happy with your life.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Roommate Issues</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p01">At many colleges students just out of high school must live in a campus residence hall. Other students may live in a shared apartment with new roommates. This is the first time many students have had to share a room, suite, or apartment with others who were not family members, and this situation may lead to conflicts and strong feelings that can even affect your academic success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p02">As in other interactions, the keys to forming a good relationship with a roommate are communication and attitude. From the beginning, you should talk about everyone’s expectations of the other(s) and what matters most to you about where you live. Don’t wait until problems happen before talking. It’s often good to begin with the key practical issues: agreeing on quiet hours for study (limiting not only loud music but also visits from others), time for lights out, neatness and cleaning up, things shared and private things not to touch.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_p03">Show respect for the other’s ideas and possessions, respect their privacy, and try to listen more than you talk. Even if your roommate does not become a close friend, you can have a harmonious, successful relationship that makes your residence a good home for both of you. Millions of college students before you have learned to work this out, and if both (or all) of you respect each other and keep communication open and nonconfrontational, you will easily get through the small bumps in the road ahead, too. Follow these guidelines to help ensure you get along well:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s07_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Anticipate problems before they happen.</strong> Think about things that you consider essential in your living environment and talk with a new roommate about these essentials now.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Deal with any problem promptly.</strong> Don’t wait until a behavior is well established before speaking up, as if the other person will somehow catch on that it aggravates you. It may be as simple as a roommate using your coffee cup or borrowing your toothpaste without asking, but if you say nothing, trying to be polite, the habit may expand to other things.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be patient, flexible, and willing to compromise.</strong> It may take a while for each of you to get used to each other and to establish a communication pattern of openness so that you can be honest with each other about what really matters.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be warm, use humor, and be sensitive.</strong> Telling someone that they’re doing something bothersome can be very difficult for many people. Think before speaking, looking for the best way to communicate what you feel. Remember, you’ll be spending a lot of time around this person, so do you really want them to think of you as bossy or obsessive-compulsive?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get out more.</strong> Sometimes it helps to spend more time elsewhere on campus, studying in the library or another quiet place. You just might need a certain amount of time a day alone. That’s fine, but don’t expect your roommate to have to leave just to give you that time alone!</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p02">Acts of harassment may be verbal, physical, psychological, or any other behavior intended to disturb another person. Bullying behavior, name-calling, belittling, gesturing obscenely, stalking, mobbing—any action intended to torment or deliberately make another person uncomfortable or feel humiliated is harassment. Harassment may also be intended to manipulate a targeted person to act in some specific way.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p03">Sexual harassment is a special term referring to persistent, unwanted sexual behaviors or advances. Sexual harassment may begin with words but progress to unwanted touching and potentially even rape. Sexual harassment is discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p04">Many types of harassment are illegal. In the workplace, a supervisor who tells off-color sexual jokes around an employee of the opposite gender may be guilty of sexual harassment. Students who deliberately malign members of another race may be guilty of committing a hate crime. Physically tormenting another student in a hazing may be judged assault and battery. Any discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, age, sex, and so on is illegal. On a college campus, any harassment of a student by a faculty member or college employee is expressly forbidden, unethical, and also possibly illegal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_p05">Harassment of any type, at any time, of any person, is wrong and unacceptable. You will know it if you are harassed, and you should know also that it is your basic right to be free of harassment and that your college has strict policies against all forms of harassment. Here’s what you should do if you are being harassed:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s08_l01">
            <li>Tell the person to stop the behavior—or if you feel at any risk of harm, get out of the situation immediately.</li>
            <li>Document the incident, particularly with ongoing harassment. Keep notes of the details. Tell someone you trust about the situation.</li>
            <li>Report the harassment to the appropriate college authority. If you are unsure which to go to, go to the dean of students first.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changing Family Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_p01">The college years are a time of many changes, including one’s relationships with parents, siblings, and one’s own children and partners. Any time there is change, issues may arise.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_p02">As in other relationships, try to understand the other’s perspective. Honesty is particularly important—but with tact and understanding. Here are some tips for getting along:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s01_s09_l01">
            <li>Understand that your parents may not change their attitudes toward you as quickly as you yourself may be changing. They may still think of you as a younger person in need of their continued guidance. They will worry about you and fear that you might fall in with the wrong crowd or engage in risky behavior. Be patient. Take the time to communicate, and don’t close yourself off. Let them gradually accept you as a more mature person who can make your own decisions wisely.</li>
            <li>Stay in touch. You may be busier than ever and feel you haven’t time for a phone call or e-mail, but communication is very important for parents—especially if they are now empty nesters without other children at home. Even if they seem to want too much involvement in your life and to make decisions for you, realize that this at least in part is simply a desire to stay in touch with you—and to feel they still matter in your life.</li>
            <li>Use your best listening skills. Understanding what they’re really feeling, which is often simply a concern for you born of their love for you, will usually help you know best to respond.</li>
            <li>Be assured that over time your parents and other family members will get used to your being on your own and will accept your ability to make your own decisions. Time itself often solves issues.</li>
            <li>With your own family, now that you are busier than ever with classes and work, you may need to pay special attention to ensuring you stay active in family relationships. Schedule times for family outings and make room in your days for casual interactions. But remember, it’s not how much time you spend together but the quality of that time, so give your family your full attention when you are together.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_p01">Ours is a very diverse society—and increasingly so. Already in many parts of the country, non-Hispanic whites comprise less than 50 percent of the population, and by 2020 an estimated one in three Americans will be a person of color, as will be about half of all college students. But “diversity” means much more than a variety of racial and ethnic differences. As we’ll use the term here, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diversity</a><span class="glossdef">A condition of having differences, generally referring to meaningful differences among various groups of people.</span></span> refers to the great variety of human characteristics—ways that we are different even as we are all human and share more similarities than differences. These differences are an essential part of what enriches humanity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_p02">We’ll look first at some of the ways that people differ and explore the benefits of diversity for our society generally and for the college experience. While we should all celebrate diversity, at the same time we need to acknowledge past issues that grew from misunderstandings of such differences and work together to bring change where needed.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Diversity Really Means</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s01_p01">Differences among people may involve where a person was born and raised, the person’s family and cultural group, factual differences in personal identity, and chosen differences in significant beliefs. Some diversity is primarily cultural (involving shared beliefs and behaviors), other diversity may be biological (race, age, gender), and some diversity is defined in personal terms (sexual orientation, religion). Diversity generally involves things that may significantly affect some people’s perceptions of others—not just any way people happen to be different. For example, having different tastes in music, movies, or books is not what we usually refer to as diversity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s01_p02">When discussing diversity, it is often difficult to avoid seeming to generalize about different types of people—and such generalizations can seem similar to dangerous <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotypes</a><span class="glossdef">A simplified and standardized image of what a certain type or group of people is like, often held in common by members of a different group.</span></span>. The following descriptions are meant only to suggest that individuals are different from other individuals in many possible ways and that we can all learn things from people whose ideas, beliefs, attitudes, values, backgrounds, experiences, and behaviors are different from our own. This is a primary reason college admissions departments frequently seek diversity in the student body. Following are various aspects of diversity:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of race.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Race</a><span class="glossdef">A human group with biological differences, typically referring to skin color and appearance.</span></span> refers to what we generally think of as biological differences and is often defined by what some think of as skin color. Such perceptions are often at least as much social as they are biological.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of ethnicity.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ethnicity</a><span class="glossdef">A set of cultural and sometimes physical characteristics of a group of people with a shared cultural background and identity.</span></span> is a cultural distinction that is different from race. An ethnic group is a group of people who share a common identity and a perceived cultural heritage that often involves shared ways of speaking and behaving, religion, traditions, and other traits. The term “ethnic” also refers to such a group that is a minority within the larger society. Race and ethnicity are sometimes interrelated but not automatically so.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of cultural background.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Culture</a><span class="glossdef">In anthropology, culture is the total of characteristic ways in which a group of people live and interact, transmitted from one generation to another; more generally, culture is the behaviors and beliefs characteristic of a particular social, ethnic, or age group.</span></span>, like ethnicity, refers to shared characteristics, language, beliefs, behaviors, and identity. We are all influenced by our culture to some extent. While ethnic groups are typically smaller groups within a larger society, the larger society itself is often called the “dominant culture.” The term is often used rather loosely to refer to any group with identifiable shared characteristics.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of educational background.</strong> Colleges do not use a cookie-cutter approach to admit only students with identical academic skills. Diversity of educational background helps ensure a free flow of ideas and challenges those who might become set in their ways.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of geography.</strong> People from different places within the United States or the world often have a range of differences in ideas, attitudes, and behaviors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of socioeconomic background.</strong> People’s identities are influenced by how they grow up, and part of that background often involves socioeconomic factors. Socioeconomic diversity can contribute a wide variety of ideas and attitudes.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gender roles</a><span class="glossdef">The roles that society or a cultural group traditionally assigns to males and females based on their gender.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> Women have virtually all professional and social roles, including those once dominated by men, and men have taken on many roles, such as raising a child, that were formerly occupied mostly by women. These changing roles have brought diverse new ideas and attitudes to college campuses.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of age.</strong> While younger students attending college immediately after high school are generally within the same age range, older students returning to school bring a diversity of age. Because they often have broader life experiences, many older students bring different ideas and attitudes to the campus.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of sexual orientation.</strong> Gays and lesbians make up a significant percentage of people in American society and students on college campuses. Exposure to this diversity helps others overcome stereotypes and become more accepting of human differences.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of religion.</strong> For many people, religion is not just a Sunday morning practice but a larger spiritual force that infuses their lives. Religion helps shape different ways of thinking and behaving, and thus diversity of religion brings a wider benefit of diversity to college.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of political views.</strong> A diversity of political views helps broaden the level of discourse on campuses concerning current events and the roles of government and leadership at all levels. College students are frequently concerned about issues such as environmentalism and civil rights and can help bring about change.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of physical ability.</strong> Some students have athletic talents. Some students have physical disabilities. Physical differences among students brings yet another kind of diversity to colleges—a diversity that both widens opportunities for a college education and also helps all students better understand how people relate to the world in physical as well as intellectual ways.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diversity of extracurricular abilities.</strong> As you remember from your college applications, colleges ask about what you do outside of class—clubs, activities, abilities in music and the arts, and so on. A student body with diverse interests and skills benefits all students by helping make the college experience full and enriching at all levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s01_p03">These are just some of the types of diversity you are likely to encounter on college campuses and in our society generally.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Benefits of Diversity</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s02_p01">The goal of many college admissions departments is to attract diverse students from a broad range of backgrounds involving different cultural, socioeconomic, age, and other factors—everything in the preceding list. But why is diversity so important? There are many reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Experiencing diversity at college prepares students for the diversity they will encounter the rest of their lives.</strong> Learning to understand and accept people different from ourselves is very important in our world. While many high school students may not have met or gotten to know well many people with different backgrounds, this often changes in college. Success in one’s career and future social life also requires understanding people in new ways and interacting with new skills. Experiencing diversity in college assists in this process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Students learn better in a diverse educational setting.</strong> Encountering new concepts, values, and behaviors leads to thinking in deeper, more complex, and more creative ways, rather than furthering past ideas and attitudes. Students who experience the most racial and ethnic diversity in their classes are more engaged in active thinking processes and develop more intellectual and academic skills (and have higher grade point averages) than others with limited experience of diversity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Attention to diversity leads to a broader range of teaching methods, which benefits the learning process for all students.</strong> Just as people are different in diverse ways, people from different backgrounds and experiences learn in different ways. College teaching has expanded to include many new teaching techniques. All students gain when instructors make the effort to address the diverse learning needs of all students.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Experiencing diversity on campus is beneficial for both minority and majority students.</strong> Students have more fulfilling social relationships and report more satisfaction and involvement with their college experience.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Students of a traditional college age are in an ideal stage of development for forming healthy attitudes about diversity.</strong> Younger students may not yet have reached a point at which they can fully understand and accept very different ideas and behaviors in others. The college years are a time of growth and maturation intellectually, socially, and emotionally, and a sustained experience of diversity is an opportunity to heighten this process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Experiencing diversity makes us all better citizens in our democracy.</strong> When people can better understand and consider the ideas and perspectives of others, they are better equipped to participate meaningfully in our society. Democratic government depends on shared values of equality and the public good. An attitude of “us versus them,” in contrast, does not further the public good or advance democratic government. Studies have shown that college graduates with a good experience of diversity generally maintain patterns of openness and inclusivity in their future lives.</li>

Society changes only slowly, and sadly, many students in some areas—including gay and lesbian students, students with disabilities, and many minority students—still feel marginalized in the dominant culture of their campuses. Even in a country that elected an African American president, racism exists in many places. Gays and lesbians are still fighting for equal rights under the law and acceptance everywhere. Women still earn less than men in the same jobs. Thus society as a whole, and colleges in particular, need to continue to work to destroy old stereotypes and achieve a full acceptance of our human differences.</p>

Unfortunately, some people think of colleges’ diversity programs as just the politically correct thing to do. Use your critical thinking skills if you hear such statements. In the world of higher education, truth is discovered through investigation and research—and research has shown repeatedly the value of diversity as well as programs designed to promote diversity.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Accepting and Celebrating Diversity and Working for Change</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_p01">More than anything, multiculturalism is an attitude. Multiculturalism involves accepting and respecting the ideas, feelings, behaviors, and experiences of people different from oneself—all the forms of diversity described earlier. America is not actually a “melting pot” in the sense that people from diverse backgrounds somehow all become the same. America has always included a great diversity of ideas, attitudes, and behaviors. For example, the constitutional separation of church and state, a fundamental principle present since early days in the United States, guarantees that people of all religion have the same freedoms and rights for worship and religious behavior. People of diverse religious backgrounds are not expected to “melt” together into one religion. Other laws guarantee the equal rights of all people regardless of skin color, gender, age, and other differences—including more recently, in some states, equality under the law for those with diverse sexual orientation. The United States does not even have an official national language—and many government and other publications in various geographical areas are offered in a variety of languages as well. In short, America as a nation has always recognized the realities and benefits of diversity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_p02">Colleges similarly make commitments to ensure they respect and value differences among people and promote a wide understanding of such differences. Most colleges now have formal diversity programs to help all students not only accept and understand differences among students of varied backgrounds but also celebrate the benefits for all.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What Students Can Do</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p01">While diversity exists in most places, not everyone automatically understands differences among people and celebrates the value of those differences. Students who never think about diversity and who make no conscious effort to experience and understand others gain less than others who do. There are many ways you can experience the benefits of diversity on your college campus, however, beginning with your own attitudes and by taking steps to increase your experiences with diverse individuals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Acknowledge your own uniqueness, for you are diverse, too.</strong> Diversity doesn’t involve just other people. Consider that you may be just as different to other people as they are to you. Don’t think of the other person as being the one who is different, that you are somehow the “norm.” Your religion may seem just as odd to them as theirs does to you, and your clothing may seem just as strange looking to them as theirs is to you—until you accept there is no one “normal” or right way to be. Look at yourself in a mirror and consider why you look as you do. Why do you use the slang you do with your friends? Why did you just have that type of food for breakfast? How is it that you prefer certain types of music? Read certain books? Talk about certain things? Much of this has to do with your cultural background—so it makes sense that someone from another cultural or ethnic background is different in some ways. But both of you are also individuals with your own tastes, preferences, ideas, and attitudes—making you unique. It’s only when you realize your own uniqueness that you can begin to understand and respect the uniqueness of others, too.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Consider your own (possibly unconscious) stereotypes.</strong> A stereotype is a fixed, simplistic view of what people in a certain group are like. It is often the basis for prejudice and discrimination: behaving differently toward someone because you stereotype them in some way. Stereotypes are generally learned and emerge in the dominant culture’s attitudes toward those from outside that dominant group. A stereotype may be explicitly racist and destructive, and it may also be a simplistic generalization applied to any group of people, even if intended to be flattering rather than negative. As you have read this chapter so far, did you find yourself thinking about any group of people, based on any kind of difference, and perhaps thinking in terms of stereotypes? If you walked into a party and saw many different kinds of people standing about, would you naturally avoid some and move toward others? Remember, we learn stereotypes from our cultural background—so it’s not a terrible thing to admit you have inherited some stereotypes. Thinking about them is a first step in breaking out of these irrational thought patterns.</p>

                    <li>Many Americans may wave their index fingers at someone else to make a point, but this gesture is often offensive to Mexicans and Somali, who may use that gesture only for dogs.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p28"><strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t apply any group generalizations to individuals.</strong> As an extension of not stereotyping any group, also don’t think of any individual person in terms of group characteristics.

Be open minded and treat everyone with respect as an individual with his or her own ideas, attitudes, and preferences.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p29"><strong class="emphasis bold">Develop cultural sensitivity for communication.</strong> Realize that your words may not mean quite the same thing in different cultural contexts or to individuals from different backgrounds. This is particularly true of slang words, which you should generally avoid until you are sure the other person will know what you mean. Never try to use slang or expressions you think are common in the cultural group of the person you are speaking with. Similarly, since body language often varies among different cultures, avoid strong gestures and expressions until the responses of the other person signify he or she will not misinterpret the messages sent by your body language.</p>

Special events, cultural fairs and celebrations, concerts, and other programs are held frequently on most campuses. There may also be opportunities to participate in group travel to other countries or regions of cultural diversity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s01_p31"><strong class="emphasis bold">Take the initiative in social interactions.</strong> Many students just naturally hang out with other students they are most like—that almost seems to be part of human nature. Even when we’re open minded and want to learn about others different from ourselves, it often seems easier and more comfortable to interact with others of the same age, cultural group, and so on. If we don’t make a small effort to meet others, however, we miss a great opportunity to learn and broaden our horizons. Next time you’re looking around the classroom or dorm for someone to ask about a class you missed or to study together for a test or group project, choose someone different from you in some way. Making friends with others of different backgrounds is often one of the most fulfilling experiences of college students.</p>

If conflict does occur, work to resolve it as you would any other tension with another person, as described earlier.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s02_p01">Unfortunately prejudice and hate still exist in America, even on college campuses. In addition to racial prejudice, some people are also prejudiced against women, people with disabilities, older adults, gays and lesbians—virtually all groups that can be characterized as “different.” All campuses have policies against all forms of prejudice and discriminatory behaviors. But it is not enough for only college administrators to fight prejudice and hate—this is a responsibility for all good citizens who take seriously the shared American value of equality for all people. So what can you as a college student do?</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Decide that it does matter.</strong> Prejudice threatens us all, not just the particular group being discriminated against in a specific incident. Don’t stand on the sidelines or think it’s up to the people who may be victimized by prejudice or hate to do something about it. We can all do something.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Talk with others.</strong> Communication has great value on campuses. Let others know how you feel about any acts of prejudice or hatred that you witness. The more everyone openly condemns such behavior, the less likely it is to reappear in the future. This applies even if you hear another student telling a racist joke or putting down the opposite sex—speak up and tell the person you find such statements offensive. You don’t want that person to think you agree with them. Speaking up can be difficult to do, but it can be done tactfully. People can and do learn what is acceptable in a diverse environment.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Report incidents you observe.</strong> If you happen to see someone spray-painting a hateful slogan, for example, be a good citizen and report it to the appropriate campus office or the police.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Support student groups working for change.</strong> America has a great tradition of college students banding together to help solve social problems. Show your support for groups and activities that celebrate diversity and condemn prejudice. Even if you are a shy, quiet person, your attendance at a parade or gathering lends support. Or you can write a letter to the editor in a student newspaper, help hand out leaflets for an upcoming rally, or put up posters on campus. Once you become aware of such student activities on campus, you’ll find many ways you can help take a stand.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Celebrate diversity.</strong> In many ways, you can learn more about diversity through campus programs and activities. The more all students participate, the closer the campus will come to being free of prejudice and hate. Be a role model in how you act and what you say in relation to diversity, and you may have more effect on others than you realize.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dealing with Prejudice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s04_p01">If you yourself experience prejudice or discrimination related to your race or ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or any other aspect of diversity, don’t just try to ignore it or accept it as something that cannot be changed. As discussed earlier, college students can do much to minimize intolerance on campus. Many overt forms of discrimination are frankly illegal and against college policies. You owe it to yourself, first and foremost, to report it to the appropriate college authority.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s04_p02">You can also attack prejudice in other ways. Join a campus organization that works to reduce prejudice or start a new group and discuss ways you can confront the problem and work for a solution. Seek solidarity with other groups. Organize positive celebrations and events to promote understanding. Write an article for a campus publication explaining the values of diversity and condemning intolerance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s02_s04_p03">What if you are directly confronted by an individual or group making racist or other discriminatory remarks? In an emotionally charged situation, rational dialogue may be difficult or impossible, and a shouting match or name-calling seldom is productive. If the person may have made an offensive remark inadvertently or because of a misunderstanding, then you may be able to calmly explain the problem with what they said or did. Hopefully the person will apologize and learn from the experience. But if the person made the remark or acted that way intentionally, confronting this negative person directly may be difficult and not have a positive outcome. Most important, take care that the situation does not escalate in the direction of violence. Reporting the incident instead to college authorities may better serve the larger purpose of working toward harmony and tolerance.</p>

                <li>Nontraditional students bring many unique characteristics to the college environment that help enrich all students’ social and educational experiences.</li>
                <li>Multiculturalism involves respecting the ideas, feelings, behaviors, and experiences different from oneself in any way. Colleges promote both diversity in the student body and multiculturalism among all students.</li>
                <li>As an individual, each of us can gain the benefits of diversity as we challenge our own stereotypes, understand and celebrate differences in others, and learn to interact well with others different from ourselves. Take advantage of campus opportunities to increase your cultural awareness and to form social relationships with diverse others.</li>
                <li>Although we would hope that all college campuses would be free of hate and discrimination, it can become necessary to take a stand against prejudice.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_p01">The college social experience also includes organized campus groups and activities. Participating in organized activities requires taking some initiative—you can’t be passive and expect these opportunities to come knocking on your door—but is well worthwhile for fully enriching college interactions. The active pursuit of a stimulating life on campus offers many benefits:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Organized groups and activities speed your transition into your new life.</strong> New students can be overwhelmed by their studies and every aspect of a new life, and they may be slow to build a new life. Rather than waiting for it to come along on its own, you can immediately begin broadening your social contacts and experiences by joining groups that share your interests.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Organized groups and activities help you experience a much greater variety of social life than you might otherwise.</strong> New students often tend to interact more with other students their own age and with similar backgrounds—this is just natural. But if you simply go with the flow and don’t actively reach out, you are much less likely to meet and interact with others from the broader campus diversity: students who are older and may have a perspective you may otherwise miss, upper-level students who have much to share from their years on campus, and students of diverse heritage or culture with whom you might otherwise be slow to interact.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Organized groups and activities help you gain new skills, whether technical, physical, intellectual, or social.</strong> Such skills may find their way into your résumé when you next seek a job or your application for a scholarship or other future educational opportunity. Employers and others like to see well-rounded students with a range of proficiencies and experiences.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Organized groups and activities are fun and a great way to stay healthy and relieve stress.</strong> As <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch10#lochhaas-ch10">Chapter 10 "Taking Control of Your Health"</a> discusses, exercise and physical activity are essential for health and well-being, and many organized activities offer a good way to keep moving.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Participating in Groups and Activities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_p01">College campuses offer a wide range of clubs, organizations, and other activities open to all students. College administrators view this as a significant benefit and work to promote student involvement in such groups. When you made your decision to attend your college, you likely received printed materials or studied the college’s Web site and saw many opportunities. But you may have been so busy attending to academic matters that you haven’t thought of these groups since. It’s a good time now to check out the possibilities:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Browse the college Web site, where you’re likely to find links to pages for student clubs and organizations.</li>
            <li>Watch for club fairs, open houses, and similar activities on campus. Especially near the beginning of the year, an activity fair may include tables set up by many groups to provide students with information. Talk with the representatives from any group in which you may be interested.</li>
            <li>Look for notices on bulletin boards around campus. Student groups really do want new students to join, so they usually try to post information where you can find it.</li>
            <li>Stop by the appropriate college office, such as the student affairs or student activities office or cultural center.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a group with very specialized interests, check with the academic offices of departments where many students with that interest may be majoring.</li>
            <li>Consider a wide variety of types of organizations. Some are primarily social; some are political or activist; some are based on hobbies (photography, chess, equestrianism, bird watching, videogaming, computer programming); some involve the arts (instrumental music, choral singing, painting, poetry writing, drama club); some are forms of physical recreation (rock-climbing, ballroom dancing, archery, yoga, table tennis, tai chi, team sports); some focus on volunteerism (tutoring other students, community service projects, food drives); and others are related to academic or intellectual pursuits (nursing club, math club, chess club, engineering club, debate club, student literary magazine).</li>
            <li>Consider other forms of involvement and roles beyond clubs. Gain leadership experience by running for office in student government or applying for a residence hall support position. If you are looking for a job, consider what kinds of people you’ll have the opportunity to interact with. <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch11#lochhaas-ch11">Chapter 11 "Taking Control of Your Finances"</a> will give you more tips for finding a job.</li>
            <li>If your campus doesn’t have a group focused on a particular activity you enjoy yourself, think about starting a new club. Your college will help you get started; talk with the student activities or affairs office.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_p02">Whatever your interests, don’t be shy about checking out a club or organization. Take chances and explore. Attending a meeting or gathering is not a commitment—you’re just going the first time to see what it’s like, and you have no obligation to join. Keep an open mind as you meet and observe other students in the group, especially if you don’t feel at first like you fit in: remember that part of the benefit of the experience is to meet others who are not necessarily just like everyone you already know.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Bridging the Generation Gap</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Is there still a “generation gap” in our society? Maybe not in the same sense as when that phrase came into being in the 1960s, but it remains generally true that most people naturally gravitate toward others of similar age. Even in the open, accepting environment of most colleges, many students interact primarily with others of similar age—which, sadly, misses a great opportunity for both older and younger students to learn from each other.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_p05">Younger, “traditional” students just out of high school usually live in residence halls and immediately meet other students of the same age. New students who are just a few years older, who usually have spent some time in the workforce before returning to their education, are more likely to live in a house or apartment and probably spend less time on campus interacting with other students. Some students may be decades older than both traditional and most untraditional students, returning to college sometimes with the desire to change careers or simply to take classes of special interest; their lives may be so well settled in other respects that they have little interest at all in the social world of college. Students in all of these groups may be slow to initiate interactions with each other.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s01_p06">This is one of the great benefits of organized campus groups and activities, however. Regardless of your age or background, you can attend a meeting of those with similar interests and have the opportunity to meet people you simply would not have crossed paths with otherwise. Age barriers rapidly break down when people share the same interests.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">When and How to Say No</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s02_p01">For all the benefits of an active social and campus life, too much of any good thing can also cause trouble. If you join too many groups, or if you have limited time because of work and family commitments, you may spend less time with your studies—with negative results. Here are some guidelines for finding a good balance between social life and everything else you need to do:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch09_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Don’t join too many organizations or clubs. Most advisors suggest that two or three regular activities are the maximum that most students can handle.</li>
            <li>Work on your time management skills, as described in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch02#lochhaas-ch02">Chapter 2 "Staying Motivated, Organized, and On Track"</a>. Plan ahead for study time when you don’t have schedule conflicts. If you have a rich social life, study in the library or places where you won’t be tempted by additional social interaction with a roommate, family member, or others passing by.</li>
            <li>Don’t be afraid to say no. You may be active in a club and have plenty of time for routine activities, but someone may ask you to spend extra time organizing an upcoming event just when you have a major paper deadline coming up. Sometimes you have to remember the main reason you’re in college and just say you can’t do it because you have to get your work done.</li>
            <li>If you really can’t resolve your time conflicts, seek help. Talk with your advisor or a college counselor. They’ll help you get back on track.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lochhaas-ch09_s04_l01">
            <li>An active social life and social interaction with a variety of people on campus contribute to college students’ well-being and overall academic success.</li>
            <li>Successfully interacting with diverse others requires effective communication skills, including both listening skills and assertive communication rather than passive or aggressive communication.</li>
            <li>Social interaction can be heightened by productive and moderate online networking.</li>
            <li>Time management and study skills help one avoid problems when balancing social life and academic studies.</li>
            <li>To prevent or resolve conflicts that may occur in any social interaction, maintain an attitude of respect for others, be open minded and willing to compromise, and know how to work together calmly to resolve conflicts.</li>
            <li>Diversity on campus is beneficial for all students, not just those from ethnic or minority groups. The wider perspectives of students from different backgrounds and the greater variety of teaching methods help everyone gain more fully in educational experiences. Socially, students develop a more mature worldview and are better prepared for interacting with a diverse world in the future.</li>
            <li>Multiculturalism involves an attitude of respect for the ideas, feelings, behaviors, and experiences of others who differ from oneself in any way. Colleges promote both diversity in the student body and multiculturalism among all students.</li>
            <li>To gain a multicultural perspective, challenge your own learned stereotypes while you learn more about other cultural groups. Understanding what can be learned from others leads to celebrating the diversity found on most campuses.</li>
            <li>Take a personal responsibility both for broadening your own social world and for speaking out against prejudice and discrimination wherever encountered.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of campus opportunities to increase your cultural awareness and to form social relationships with diverse others. Organized campus groups and events can help you broaden your horizons in many beneficial ways.</li>
            <li>Participation in campus clubs and other organizations is not only fun and a good way to reduce stress but also helps develop social, intellectual, and technical skills that may serve you well in your future career or other endeavors.</li>
