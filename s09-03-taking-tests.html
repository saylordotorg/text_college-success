        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Tests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p01">All tests are designed to determine how much you know about a particular subject at a particular point in time. But you should be aware of differences in types of tests because this will help guide how you prepare for them. Two general types of tests are based on their objectives, or how they are intended to be used: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formative assessments</a><span class="glossdef">A test or quiz used to determine a student’s basic understanding of material before taking on more challenging ideas.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summative assessments</a><span class="glossdef">A test or exam used by an instructor to determine if a student has mastered the material sufficiently to get credit for the course.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Formative assessments include quizzes, unit tests, pop quizzes, and review quizzes from a textbook or its Web site. Their main objective is to make sure you know the fundamental material before moving on to more challenging topics. Because these quizzes usually don’t count much toward your final grade, many students think they are not very important. In fact, these quizzes are very important, particularly to you; they can help you to identify what you know and what you still need to learn to be successful in the course and in applying the material. A poor result on a quiz may not negatively affect your final grade much—but learning from its results and correcting your mistakes <em class="emphasis">will</em> affect your final grade, on the positive side, when you take midterms and finals! More on this in <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06#lochhaas-ch06">Chapter 6 "Preparing for and Taking Tests"</a>, <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch06_s06#lochhaas-ch06_s06">Section 6.6 "Using Test Results"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p03">Summative assessments include midterms and finals. They are used by the instructor to determine if you are mastering a large portion of the material, and as such, they usually carry a heavy weight toward your final grade for the course. Because of this, they often result in high levels of test anxiety and long study periods.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_p04">In addition to this classification by objective, tests can also be grouped into various categories based on how they are delivered. Each type has its own peculiar strategies.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Paper tests</strong> are still the most common type of test, requiring students to write answers on the test pages or in a separate test booklet. They are typically used for in-class tests. Neatness and good grammar count, even if it’s not an English exam. Remember that the instructor will be reading dozens of test papers and will not likely spend much time trying to figure out your hieroglyphics, arrows, and cross-outs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Open-book tests</strong> allow the student to consult their notes, textbook, or both while taking the exam. Instructors often give this type of test when they are more interested in seeing your thoughts and critical thinking than your memory power. Be prepared to expose and defend your own viewpoints. When preparing, know where key material is present in your book and notes; create an index for your notes and use sticky notes to flag key pages of your textbook before the exam. Be careful when copying information or formulas to your test answers, because nothing looks worse in an open-book exam than misusing the material at your disposal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take-home tests</strong> are like open-book tests except you have the luxury of time on your side. Make sure you submit the exam on time. Know what the instructor’s expectations are about the content of your answers. The instructor will likely expect more detail and more complete work because you are not under a strict time limit and because you have access to reference materials. Be clear about when the test is due. (Some instructors will ask you to e-mail your exam to them by a specific time.) Also find out if the instructor allows or expects you to collaborate with classmates. Be sure to type your exam and don’t forget to spell-check!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Online tests</strong> are most commonly used for formative assessments, although they are starting to find their way into high-stakes exams, particularly in large lecture classes that fulfill a graduation requirement (like introductory psychology or history survey courses). The main advantage of online tests is that they can be computer graded, providing fast feedback to the student (with formative tests) and allowing the instructor to grade hundreds of exams easily (with summative assessments). Since these tests are computer graded, be aware that the instructor’s judgment is not involved in the grading. Your answers will be either right or wrong; there is no room for partially correct responses. With online tests, be sure you understand the testing software. Are there practice questions? If so, make sure you use them. Find out if you will be allowed to move freely between test sections to go back and check your work or to complete questions you might have skipped. Some testing software does not allow you to return to sections once they are “submitted.” Unless your exam needs to be taken at a specific time, don’t wait until the last minute to take the test. Should you have technical problems, you want to have time to resolve the issues. To avoid any conflicts with the testing software, close all other software applications before beginning the testing software.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Electronic tests in the classroom</strong> are becoming more common as colleges install “smart classrooms” with technology such as wireless “clicker” technology that instructors may use to get a quick read of students’ understanding of a lecture. This testing method allows for only true-or-false and multiple-choice questions, so it is rarely used for summative assessments. When taking this kind of quick quiz, take notes on questions you miss so that you can focus on them when you do your own review.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Presentations and oral tests</strong> are the most complete means for instructors to evaluate students’ mastery of material, because the evaluation is highly interactive. The instructor can (and likely will) probe you on certain points, question your assumptions, or ask you to defend your point of view. Make sure you practice your presentation many times with and without an audience (your study group is good for this). Have a clear and concise point of view and keep to the allotted time. (You don’t want to miss delivering a killer close if your instructor cuts you off because you weren’t aware of the time!) <a class="xref" href="lochhaas-ch07#lochhaas-ch07">Chapter 7 "Interacting with Instructors and Classes"</a> covers public speaking and class presentations in more detail. Use the same strategies in oral exams.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tips for Taking Tests</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_p01">You’ve reviewed the material for a test and feel confident that you will do well. You have brought your test anxiety into control. What else can you do to ensure success on a test? Learn and apply these top ten test-taking strategies:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn as much as you can about the test.</strong> What has the instructor told you about the test? Will it be open book? What types of questions will be on it? Are there parts of the test that will be worth more points than others? Will it be cumulative or just cover the most recent material? Will you have choices about which questions to answer?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Try to foresee the questions likely to be on the test.</strong> What kinds of questions would you include if you were the instructor? Brainstorm possible questions with your study group. Look for possible questions in your notes. Review past quizzes and tests to see what kinds of questions the instructor likes to ask. Above all, take it seriously whenever your instructor warns, “This will be on the test.”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t be tempted to stay up late cramming. Get some exercise and watch what you eat.</strong> Cramming is not a substitute for doing your assignments and studying consistently over time. It is far more important to get a good night’s sleep and face your test fresh and well rested. A good workout the day before an exam will help you be fresh and stay focused during the exam (provided you already like to work out; if not, find time to take a long walk). A healthy diet the night before and the day of the exam will give you energy and concentration to do well on the exam. Include “brain foods,” such as those rich in omega-3 oils, and avoid “heavy” foods that are rich in fat and sugar. (After the exam, you can celebrate with a cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake—but not before the exam!)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get to the test site early.</strong> Take out all your allowable tools (pencils, pens, calculator, etc.). Turn off your cell phone (yes, all the way off, not on vibrate) as a way of disconnecting from your everyday world. Do some of the relaxation exercises described earlier for controlling test anxiety.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create a test plan.</strong> Listen carefully to the directions given by the instructor. When you receive your test, scan the entire test first. Evaluate the importance of each section. Then create a time allocation plan. Decide how much time you should dedicate to each section. You don’t want to spend 80 percent of your time on a question worth 10 percent of the grade.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write it down.</strong> Take a couple minutes to write down key facts, dates, principles, statistics, and formulas on a piece of scratch paper or in the margin of the exam paper. Do this while you are still fresh and aren’t yet feeling time pressure (when it will be harder to remember them). Then you can refer to these notes as you take the exam.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read the directions carefully.</strong> Then reread them. Do you understand what is expected of you? If not, ask the instructor to be sure you are clear. Too many students lose points simply by not following directions completely!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do the easy questions first.</strong> By getting the easy questions out of the way, you’ll feel more confident about the test and have more time to think about the tougher questions. Start with the objective sections of the exam first (multiple choice, true or false, and matching columns). As you answer these questions, keep an eye out for facts or concepts you may want to use later in an essay question.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep an eye on the time.</strong> Keep as close to your plan as possible. If you see that you are running out of time, don’t panic. Move to those questions you think you can still answer accurately within the remaining time.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check your work.</strong> This doesn’t mean going through all your calculations again. Start by ensuring that you have <em class="emphasis">complete</em> answers according to the directions. Then look for other common mistakes, such as a misplaced decimal point, dropped words (especially those that can modify the answer, like “not”), and any incomplete or incomprehensible phrases.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Strategies for Math and Science Exams</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p01">Math tests require some special strategies because they are often problem based rather than question based.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Do the following before the test:</strong></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Attend all classes and complete all assignments. Pay special attention to working on all assigned problems. After reviewing problems in class, take careful notes about what you did incorrectly. Repeat the problem and do a similar one as soon as possible. It is important that the last solution to a problem in your mind is a correct solution.</li>
                <li>Think about how each problem solution might be applied in a real-world situation. This helps make even the most complex solutions relevant and easier to learn.</li>
                <li>In your study group, take turns presenting solutions to problems and observing and correcting everyone’s work.</li>
                <li>If you are having difficulty with a concept, get help right away. Remember that math especially builds new material on previous material, so if you are having trouble with a concept now, you are likely to have trouble going forward. Make an appointment with your instructor, your teaching assistant, or a skilled classmate. Check with your college’s academic support office to see about a tutor. Don’t be shy about asking for a tutor—tutoring is not just for students needing remedial help; many successful students seek them out, too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Do the following during the test:</strong></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l02">
                <li>Review the entire test before you start and work the problems you feel most confident with first.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Approach each problem following three distinct steps:</p>
                    <ol class="orderedlist" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l03">
                        <li>Read the problem through twice: the first time to get the full concept of the question, and the second time to draw out pertinent information. After you read through the problem the first time, ask yourself, “What is this problem about?” and “What is the answer likely to look like?” The second time through, consider these questions: “What facts do I have available?” “What do I know?” “What measurable units must the answer be in?” Think about the operations and formulas you will need to use. Try to estimate a ballpark answer.</li>
                        <li>Compute your answer. First, eliminate as many unknowns as possible. You may need to use a separate formula for each unknown. Use algebraic formulas as far as you can before plugging in actual numbers; that will make it easier to cancel and combine factors. Remember that you may need two or more tries before you come up with the answer.</li>
                        <li>Check your work. Start by comparing your actual answer to the estimate you made when you first read the problem. Does your final answer sound likely? Check your arithmetic by opposite operations: use multiplication to check division and addition to check subtraction, and so on.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p04">You should consider using these three steps whenever you are working with any math problems, not just when you get problems on tests.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p05">Science tests also are often problem based, but they also generally use the scientific method. This is why science tests may require some specific strategies.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="lochhaas-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l04">
                <li>Before the test, review your lab notes as well as your class notes and assignments. Many exam questions build upon lab experience, so pay close attention to your notes, assignments, and labs. Practice describing the experimental process.</li>
                <li>Read the question carefully. What does the instructor expect you to do? Prove a hypothesis? Describe an experiment? Summarize research? Underline the words that state the objective of the question.</li>
                <li>Look carefully at all the diagrams given with the question. What do they illustrate? Why are they included with the question? Are there elements on the diagram you are expected to label?</li>
                <li>Many science questions are based on the scientific method and experimental model. When you read the test question, identify the hypothesis the problem is proposing; be prepared to describe an experimental structure to prove a hypothesis. When you check your work, make sure the hypothesis, experimental steps, and a summary of results (or expected results) are clear. Some of these elements may be part of the question, while others you may need to provide in your answer.</li>

                    <li>Before the exam, learn as much as you can about the kinds of questions your instructor will be asking and the specific material that will be covered.</li>
                    <li>The first step to successful completion of any exam is to browse the entire exam and develop a plan (including a “time budget”) for completing the exam.</li>
